{{< c8y-admon-req >}}
Users must install a TOTP application on their smartphone (Google Authenticator is recommended), freely available both on App Store and Play Store.
{{< /c8y-admon-req >}}

### To set up TOTP {#to-set-up-totp}

Opposed to the SMS strategy TOTP must be set up by each user. By opening **User settings** in the top right corner and then clicking **Set up two-factor authentication** they can start the setup process.

IF TFA is enabled, the user will be presented a QR code at login, that needs to be scanned with the previously installed TOTP mobile application.

Alternatively, the secret can also be inserted manually in case scanning the QR code is not an option.

After this process the mobile application will generate a new code every 30 seconds that can be used to complete the authentication process.

### To revoke the secret {#to-revoke-the-secret}

If a user loses access to the TFA code, for example, if a user loses the phone or uninstalls the application, and needs to set it up again, the secret must be revoked.
TOTP must be set up by each user individually.

{{< c8y-admon-req >}}

Users can not revoke their own TOTP secret. The secret of a user is only revoked by their respective parent user.
See [{{< enterprise-tenant >}} > Managing user hierarchies](/users-guide/enterprise-tenant/#managing-user-hierarchies) in the *User guide* for detailed information on user hierarchies.
