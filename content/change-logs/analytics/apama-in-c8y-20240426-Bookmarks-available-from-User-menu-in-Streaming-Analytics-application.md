The right drawer of the Streaming Analytics application, which is displayed when you click the **User** button, now includes a **Bookmarks** section. This means that the bookmarks you have added in other Cumulocity IoT applications are now also available in the Streaming Analytics application, and you can now also add bookmarks for the pages in the Streaming Analytics application.
