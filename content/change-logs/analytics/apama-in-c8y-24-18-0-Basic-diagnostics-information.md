The EPL memory profiler snapshots, which were previously only included in the enhanced diagnostics information, are now also included in the basic diagnostics information. This is helpful in case a high memory usage alarm is raised when the Apama-ctrl microservice consumes 90% of the maximum memory permitted for the microservice container and you only have basic diagnostics information available. See also [Downloading diagnostics and logs](https://cumulocity.com/docs/streaming-analytics/troubleshooting/#diagnostics-download) in the user documentation.
