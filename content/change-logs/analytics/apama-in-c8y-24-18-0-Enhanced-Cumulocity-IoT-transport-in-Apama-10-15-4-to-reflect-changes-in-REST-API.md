Due to a change in Cumulocity IoT announced with [release 10.17](https://cumulocity.com/releasenotes/release-10-17-0/announcements-10-17-0), Apama 10.15.4 now explicitly sets `withTotalPages` to `true` for applicable requests.

Range-based queries (such as `FindManagedObject`) attempt to retrieve all resources matching the query parameters by default. Explicitly setting a value for `currentPage` or setting `withTotalPages` to `false` can improve the query performance by disabling paging. See the information on REST usage and query result paging in the [Cumulocity IoT OpenAPI Specifications](https://cumulocity.com/api/core/#section/REST-implementation/REST-usage) for more information.
