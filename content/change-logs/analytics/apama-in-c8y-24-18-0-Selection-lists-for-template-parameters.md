You can now create a selection list for an Analytics Builder template parameter. This allows the model author to provide a predefined list of values for the user to choose from, ensuring that the user only enters the values you allow.
You can define selection lists for types such as string, float, source or destination, or geofence and you can also select a specific value to be the default value. The values that you define for a selection list are then available for selection when you create instances of the model.
See also [Adding a selection list for a template parameter](https://cumulocity.com/docs/streaming-analytics/analytics-builder/#adding-a-selection-list-for-a-template-parameter) in the user documentation.
