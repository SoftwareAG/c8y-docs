As announced earlier, see also [release 10.17](https://cumulocity.com/releasenotes/release-10-17-0/announcements-10-17-0), shared classes, components and services from the @c8y/ngx-components/device-grid are deprecated. Those deprecated items have now been removed.

This change only affects you, if you or your development team use the Web SDK to extend Cumulocity IoT UI applications or to build your own web applications. If you use the device-grid functionalities, check the deprecation documentation and alter your code accordingly. Refer to the deprecations in the [WebSDK resources documentation for the device-grid service](http://resources.cumulocity.com/documentation/websdk/ngx-components/injectables/DeviceGridService.html). Other deprecations for reference are also marked in this documentation.
