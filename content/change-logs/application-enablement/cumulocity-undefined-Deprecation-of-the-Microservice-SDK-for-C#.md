With the introduction of auto-generated SDKs, we provide an always up-to-date developer library with the purpose to facilitate the development of Cumulocity IoT microservices in different programming languages including C#.

The new auto-generated SDKs make our existing Microservice SDK for C# obsolete. For this reason, the Microservice SDK for C# has been removed from our public product documentation.

To learn more about using the auto-generated SDKs, refer to our respective [GitHub repository](https://github.com/SoftwareAG/cumulocity-clients-dotnet).
