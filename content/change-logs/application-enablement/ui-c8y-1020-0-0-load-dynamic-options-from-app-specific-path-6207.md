To provide more flexibility for configuring applications, Cumulocity IoT now supports loading dynamic options from application-specific paths. With this change, each hosted application will load its dynamic options from a path that includes the application context path. This allows application-specific configurations to be loaded dynamically.
The Cockpit application would now load it's dynamic options from: `/apps/public/public-options@app-cockpit/options.json` while it previously did so from: `/apps/public/public-options/options.json`.
This change was done as a preparation for upcoming changes to the branding manager.
