To simplify plugin development and deployment, support for module-less plugins has been added. With this change, plugins no longer require a module to function, allowing to implement and deploy plugins more easily. This impacts plugin developers who can now create plugins without the overhead of a module, and users who can benefit from a wider variety of available plugins that are simpler to install and use.
