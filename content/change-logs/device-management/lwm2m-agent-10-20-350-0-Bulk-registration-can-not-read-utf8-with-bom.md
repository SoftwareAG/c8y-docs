When an Excel-generated CSV file was submitted to the LWM2M bulk device registration, the process failed due to the inability to parse the UTF-8 with a BOM marker present at the beginning of the file. This issue has been addressed, and the LWM2M bulk device registration system now successfully accepts CSV files encoded in UTF-8 with BOM format.
