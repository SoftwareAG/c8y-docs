In previous versions, the LWM2M agent did not utilize appropriate formats to serialize link arrays, opaque data, and date formats in operation responses. With this update, the LWM2M agent now provides adequate and consistent representations for these data types in both operation responses and the LWM2M Objects tab. Key changes include:

The LWM2M agent now employs hex strings for representing opaque data in operation responses and the LWM2M Objects tab.
Link arrays are maintained using the CoRE link syntax in both locations.
Date values in operation responses are converted into a JSON fragment, encompassing both a human-readable time string and a timestamp value.
