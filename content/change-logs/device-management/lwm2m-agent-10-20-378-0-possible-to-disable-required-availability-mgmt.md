Cumulocity provides [connectivity monitoring](https://cumulocity.com/docs/device-management-application/monitoring-and-controlling-devices/#to-monitor-the-connection-of-a-particular-device) capabilities for which a required interval needs to be defined. For LwM2M device, this is automatically set by the LWM2M agent based on the registration lifetime. However, if the value is set manually, it will be overwritten by the LWM2M agent after each registration or registration update. This behavior can now be disabled both globally or for specific devices, allowing users to define the required interval independent of the registration lifetime.
