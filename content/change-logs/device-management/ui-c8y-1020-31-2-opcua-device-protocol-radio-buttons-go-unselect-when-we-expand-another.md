In the OPC-UA device protocol configuration, users could select a radio button for a specific variable. However, when expanding another variable in the same view, the previously selected radio button would become unselected. This issue has now been resolved. With this fix, the radio button selection is properly maintained even when expanding other variables in the view. Users no longer need to reselect the desired radio button after inspecting other variables.
