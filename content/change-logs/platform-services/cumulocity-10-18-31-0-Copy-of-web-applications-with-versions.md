It is now possible to copy web applications with versions (packages) and web applications with SHARED availability. For applications with versions, by default the application with the “latest” tag is copied. The new application has a single version and no tags. If you want to copy different versions of an application, you can specify the query parameters “tag” or “version” (only a single version). For details, refer to the [Cumulocity IoT OpenAPI Specification](http://cumulocity.com/api/).
