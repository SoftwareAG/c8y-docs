Previously, the tenant option which is used to enable [latest measurement values](https://cumulocity.com/docs/standard-tenant/managing-data/#latest-value) was not not working with the wildcard (`*`) character. With this change, the wildcard character can be used to enable latest measurements for all series:

`PUT /tenant/options/measurement.series.latestvalue`
```json
{
  "*":""
}
```
