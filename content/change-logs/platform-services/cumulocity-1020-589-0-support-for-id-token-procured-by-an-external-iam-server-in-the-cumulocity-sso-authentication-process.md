Support for ID tokens provided by external IAM servers has been added and can now be used in the authentication process via SSO. Previously, only access tokens were supported by the Cumulocity platform. Now, the administrator can decide through the configuration whether user data retrieved from the external server, such as first name, last name, phone number, email, and roles, should be loaded from the access token or the ID token.
