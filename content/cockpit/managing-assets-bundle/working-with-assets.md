### To navigate assets

In the asset hierarchy, {{< product-c8y-iot >}} distinguishes between top-level groups and subassets. Subassets can either be other groups or devices.

In the navigator, top-level groups are shown in the **Groups** menu at top-level. Subassets are shown under its higher-level group.

Moreover, subassets are shown in the **Subassets** tab of the particular group which is initially displayed when you click on the group in the navigator.

{{< c8y-admon-info >}}
The count displayed on top of the table on the **Subassets** tab shows the total number of child assets assigned to the current group. Any type of managed object can be a child asset. For more details on the counting of objects refer to the operation [Retrieve all child assets of a specific managed object](https://{{< domain-c8y >}}/api/core/{{< c8y-current-version >}}/#operation/getManagedObjectChildAssetsResource) in the {{< openapi >}}.

If you add a gateway device, the child devices are not shown. To show child devices, you must add them to the related asset. Details related to the child hierarchy are visible and editable in the Device management application.
{{< /c8y-admon-info >}}

Use the navigator, to navigate through the asset hierarchy.

### Asset details

Depending on the asset type (group or device), various tabs are available with detailed information.

Groups show the following tabs:

- **Smart rules** - Shows smart rules specified for the group, see also [Smart rules](#smart-rules).
- **Data explorer** - Shows all data points of the children. For details refer to [Visualizing data using the data explorer](#data-explorer).

If dashboards have been created for a group or device, they will also be added as a tab. See [Working with dashboards](#dashboards) for details.

Moreover, additional tabs may be displayed here in case the application has been extended with a custom Web SDK extension. Take a look at our [Web SDK tutorials](/web/tutorials/#add-a-tab-to-a-device) to see how to add a custom tab.

### To remove a device from a group

1. Navigate to the **Subassets** tab of the group.
2. Hover over the respective device you want to remove and click the remove icon at the right.

Removing a device does not delete the device, subdevices or any associated data. The device is only removed from its location in the asset hierarchy. It can be assigned to this group or other groups later.
