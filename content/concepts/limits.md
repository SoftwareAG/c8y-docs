Your {{< product-c8y-iot >}} service includes so-called ``quotas``. These quotas ensure that the service operates within the guarantees of the {{< product-c8y-iot >}} service-level agreements.

There are three types of quotas in {{< product-c8y-iot >}}:

* **Hard**: Services enforce this quota so that it cannot be exceeded.
* **Soft**: Services are guaranteed to operate within the specified service-level agreements as long as the quotas are not exceeded; however, exceeding the quotas may result in a degraded user experience and no assurance of meeting the service-level agreements.
* **Configurable**: Services enforce this quota, but a change of the quota may be requested through technical support. A change in the quota may impact the service price.

The quotas listed here reflect the maximum values for the standard cloud subscription unless indicated otherwise. For edge deployments, please consult the [{{< product-c8y-iot >}} Edge documentation](/edge).
