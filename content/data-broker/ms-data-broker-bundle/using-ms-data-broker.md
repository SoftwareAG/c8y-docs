##### Notice of reduced storage limits for Notifications 2.0 and microservice-based data broker

**Effective Date:** July 1st, 2024

Please be aware that the storage limits for microservice-based data broker will be significantly reduced. For detailed information about these changes and how they may impact your usage, please refer to [this announcement](https://cumulocity.com/docs/change-logs/?component=.component-messaging-service#cumulocity-undefined-advance-notice-of-reduced-storage-limits-for-notifications-2.0-and-microservice-based-data-broker).

If you have any questions or concerns, please contact [product support](https://cumulocity.com/docs/additional-resources/contacting-support/).

{{< /c8y-admon-important >}}

The microservice-based data broker is powered by the {{< product-c8y-iot >}} Messaging Service that enables reliable, scalable and high-performance movement of IoT data. The microservice-based data broker is similar to the existing data broker in its functionality, except that a microservice, the `databroker-agent-server`, must be enabled to make use of it.

{{< c8y-admon-req >}}
The {{< product-c8y-iot >}} Messaging Service is an optional component of the {{< product-c8y-iot >}} platform that may need to be enabled before the microservice-based data broker can be used.
The original data broker will continue to operate alongside the microservice-based data broker for the time being, and users can choose which data broker to use on a per-tenant basis.

For the shared public cloud instances of the {{< product-c8y-iot >}} platform, the Messaging Service is enabled by default on release 10.13 and above, and the microservice-based data broker can be enabled on request for individual tenants that already have access to the original data broker.
For dedicated and self-hosted instances, the Messaging Service and microservice-based data broker are available for release 10.10 and above, but will need to be explicitly enabled.

Please [contact product support](/additional-resources/contacting-support/) to inquire about using the Messaging Service and microservice-based data broker capabilities in your {{< product-c8y-iot >}} environment.
See the *Messaging Service - Installation & operations guide* for further technical details of the configuration required, but note that these tasks can only be performed by a {{< product-c8y-iot >}} platform operator, not by a normal user.

In summary, to work with the microservice-based data broker, the following requirements must be met:
  * The {{< product-c8y-iot >}} Messaging Service should be available on your {{< product-c8y-iot >}} platform.
  * Your tenant must be subscribed to the application “feature-broker”.
  * Your tenant must be subscribed to the microservice “databroker-agent-server”.
