The {{< product-c8y-iot >}} DataHub instance you have access to is tenant-specific, i.e., this instance solely serves your tenant. You use your {{< product-c8y-iot >}} account to access your {{< product-c8y-iot >}} DataHub instance.

In addition to your {{< product-c8y-iot >}} account, you have a separate account (which is created during the initial setup) for accessing Dremio. Contact your administrator for the Dremio account credentials. On the **Home** page there is a direct link to the Dremio instance under **Quick links**.
