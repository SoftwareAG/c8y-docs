### {{< product-c8y-iot >}} DataHub Edge at a glance {#datahub-edge-at-a-glance}

[{{< product-c8y-iot >}} Edge](/edge-server/overview/) is an onsite, single-server, and single-tenant variant of the {{< product-c8y-iot >}} Core platform. It is delivered as a software appliance designed to run on industrial PCs or local servers. {{< product-c8y-iot >}} DataHub is available as an add-on to {{< product-c8y-iot >}} Edge.

{{< product-c8y-iot >}} DataHub Edge offers the same functionality as the cloud-variant of {{< product-c8y-iot >}} DataHub, but stores the data locally. You can define offloading pipelines, which regularly move data from the Operational Store of {{< product-c8y-iot >}} into a data lake. In the Edge setup, a NAS is used as data lake. Dremio, the internal engine of {{< product-c8y-iot >}} DataHub, can access the data lake and run analytical queries against its contents, using SQL as the query interface.

{{< product-c8y-iot >}} DataHub Edge consists of the following building blocks:

* The {{< product-c8y-iot >}} DataHub UI is deployed as a web application in the {{< product-c8y-iot >}} core. It provides the frontend for defining and managing offloading pipelines.
* The {{< product-c8y-iot >}} DataHub backend manages offloading pipelines and their scheduled execution. The backend and its associated database run within one Docker container in the Docker daemon. Its internal state, for example, the defined offloading configurations, is persisted on the central data disk.
* The query processing is based on a Dremio master and a Dremio executor as well as on a ZooKeeper instance. Dremio master and ZooKeeper run in one Docker container and the Dremio executor runs in another one. Both containers are run by the Docker daemon. The internal state of the containers, for example, the query job history, is persisted on the central data disk. In the above figure just Dremio is shown for reasons of simplicity.
* The data lake is located on the central data disk.

#### {{< product-c8y-iot >}} DataHub Edge versus {{< product-c8y-iot >}} DataHub cloud deployments {#datahub-edge-versus-datahub-cloud-deployments}

{{< product-c8y-iot >}} DataHub Edge uses the same software as {{< product-c8y-iot >}} DataHub, though in the following aspects these two variants differ:
