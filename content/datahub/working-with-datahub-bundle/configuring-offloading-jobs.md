    title: Configuring offloading jobs
    content: "Offloading refers to moving data from a **Cumulocity IoT base collection** to a data lake. The document-based entities of the base collection are transformed into a relational format by flattening the entries and mapping them to relational rows. The mapping automatically extracts a standard set of attributes from each entity and transforms them into columns in the data lake table. Contents of measurement fragments and non-standard fields can be offloaded as well. As a result of these extraction and transformation steps, the flattened data is stored in Parquet files in the data lake.


    For each **offloading pipeline**, a **target table** is created in Dremio that points to the corresponding data folders in the data lake. These target tables are used to run queries with Dremio against the offloaded data. Each active pipeline is executed in a periodic manner and offloads newly arrived data from the base collection to the data lake.


    Click **Offload collection** to create a new offloading configuration. Click **Export** to export all configurations to a file and **Import** to import configurations from a file. The offloading list comprises all configured pipelines with options to activate/deactivate, edit, or delete a pipeline. If the pipeline has already been executed, details of the corresponding last run like status, runtime, and number of offloaded records are provided."

The following steps describe how to set up an offloading pipeline.

### Defining an offloading configuration {#defining-an-offloading-configuration}

To define an offloading configuration, click **Offload collection** to start a wizard which guides you through the main steps:

* [Select collection](#select-collection)
* [Configure target table](#configure-target-table)
* [Set additional result columns](#set-additional-result-columns)
* [Set filter predicate](#set-filter-predicate)
* [Set task details](#set-task-details)
* [Configure additional settings and complete configuration](#configure-additional-settings)

The wizard prepopulates settings for the different steps to ease the configuration process. You can modify those settings according to your needs.

#### Select collection {#select-collection}

In the dropdown box select one of the {{< product-c8y-iot >}} base collections, which are:

* alarms
* events
* inventory
* measurements

{{< c8y-admon-info >}}
You can define multiple offloading pipelines for each {{< product-c8y-iot >}} collection, except for the case of a TrendMiner offloading configuration, which must be singleton. As an example for multiple pipelines, you can filter the alarms collection by different criteria with each one resulting in a separate pipeline.
{{< /c8y-admon-info >}}

In [Offloading {{< product-c8y-iot >}} base collections](/datahub/working-with-datahub/#offloading-base-collections) you will find a summary of the default attributes being offloaded per base collection.

Click **Next** to proceed with the next configuration step. Click **Cancel** to cancel the offloading configuration.

#### Configure target table {#configure-target-table}

Once you have selected a collection for offloading, you must specify the target table in the data lake. The **Target table name** denotes the folder name in the data lake. In this folder, which will be automatically created, the offloaded data will be stored. In Dremio a table is created with the same name, pointing to this data lake folder. This table is used when querying the corresponding data lake folder and thus the offloaded data. The target table name must follow these syntax rules:

* It needs to start with an alphanumeric character (letters and numbers).
* It may contain alphanumeric characters, underscores (_) and dashes (-).
* Each underscore or dash must be preceded by an alphanumeric character.
* The name must be at least two characters long.

Each pipeline must have its own target table in the data lake. Thus, you must select distinct target table names for each offloading configuration.

For the **alarms**, **events**, and **inventory** collections, you only need to specify the target table name in this step.

For the **measurements** collection, additional settings are required. The **Target table layout** refers to the way the measurements are stored. Measurements in the base collection may have different types. For example, the collection may contain temperature, humidity, and pressure measurements. Depending on your layout choice, measurements are stored differently in the target table.

The layout **One table for one measurement type (Default)** creates a table containing only measurements of one specific type; measurements of other types are not included. When selecting this layout, you must additionally specify the **measurement type** to which the offloaded measurements are restricted. To identify existing measurement types, {{< product-c8y-iot >}} DataHub automatically inspects a subset of the data, including initial as well as latest data. In the measurement type dropdown box, these auto-detected types are listed. If a specific type you are looking for has not been detected, you can manually enter it in this box. Alternatively you can click **Refresh** next to the dropdown box to manually re-trigger the detection of measurement types. As this might be a performance-intensive process, you should trigger it only if you know that the expected measurement type is present in data recently inserted into the collection. You can trigger such a refresh only every five minutes for performance reasons.  

The layout **All measurement types in one table (TrendMiner)** creates a table containing measurements of all types. To distinguish the measurements, the table has a column which lists for each measurement its corresponding type. The specific table schema for this layout is listed in [Offloading {{< product-c8y-iot >}} base collections](/datahub/working-with-datahub/#offloading-base-collections). This layout is only for use cases where you want to offload the data into the data lake, so that TrendMiner can consume the data for its time-series analytics. When this layout is selected, the target table name is set to a fixed, non-editable name, which TrendMiner expects for its data import. To learn more about the interaction between TrendMiner and {{< product-c8y-iot >}} DataHub, see [Integrating {{< product-c8y-iot >}} DataHub with TrendMiner](/datahub/integrating-datahub-with-other-products/#integration-trendminer).

For each base collection, a default set of data fields is derived. This set defines the default schema of the target table with the columns capturing the data fields. The set is fix for each collection and cannot be modified. Select **Show default schema** to show the columns of the default schema with their corresponding name and type.

Click **Next** to proceed with the next configuration step. Click **Finish** to jump directly to the final step. Both steps will fail if the associated base collection is empty, as it prevents necessary schema investigations. In such a case you must ensure that the base collection is not empty before you can proceed with the offloading configuration. Click **Previous** to go back one configuration step. Click **Cancel** to cancel the offloading configuration wizard.


#### Set additional result columns {#set-additional-result-columns}

If you have added additional top-level fields while feeding data into {{< product-c8y-iot >}} and you want to access them in your {{< product-c8y-iot >}} DataHub queries, then you can include them in the offloading process by setting them as additional result columns. You can also use additional result columns to offload data fields in the base collection which are not part of the default schema. Additional result columns can be configured optionally. The TrendMiner case does not support this option.

**Auto-detected columns**

To ease the configuration process, {{< product-c8y-iot >}} DataHub auto-detects additional result columns. Using a sample of the base collection, {{< product-c8y-iot >}} DataHub searches for additional top-level fields and provides them as additional result columns. You can either include such an auto-detected column in your offloading or not. As the auto-detection logic relies on a sample, not all additional top-level fields might be captured. You can manually add a column to include a field you miss.

**Structure of additional result columns**

Each additional result column, whether it is manually configured or auto-detected, has the following properties:

- **Selected**: With this checkbox, you define if the column is included in the offloading pipeline or not.
- **Column name**: The column name is the name the column will have in the target table. The column name must be unique, non-empty, and contain at least one non-whitespace character.
- **Auto-detected**: This property denotes whether the column has been auto-detected or manually added by the user.
- **Source definition**: The source definition is the actual SQL expression, which defines what the data in this column looks like.
- **Column type**: The column type defines which kind of data the column contains, for example, DOUBLE for double values or VARCHAR for strings.

When entering the configuration step for additional result columns, all columns and their properties are shown in a table, with one additional result column per row. At the top right the **Hide auto-detected columns** checkbox allows you to either show the auto-detected columns or not. On the right side of each additional result column, a collapse button and a context menu is available. With the collapse button you can expand/collapse more details of the column. In the details section you can explore the source definition as well as sample data of the column. In the context menu of an additional result column you find actions for editing, duplicating, or deleting the column. The column name can also be edited inline by clicking into the name field, adapting the name, and clicking once outside the field.

At the top right of the table you find a button for manually adding an additional result column.

If you enter the additional result columns step for an active offloading pipeline, that is, the pipeline is scheduled, you cannot modify the columns.

<img src="/images/datahub-guide/datahub-configure-addtl-cols.png" alt="Overview of additional result columns" style="max-width: 100%">

**Add an additional result column**

When adding an additional result column, a dialog box for defining the column opens. You need to define a unique column name as well as a source definition. You can validate the source definition and preview its results by clicking **Validate and preview**.

Regarding the source definition, the first step is to specify a field from the base collection in the source definition editor. Then you can optionally apply SQL functions to adapt the data of this field to your needs, for example, by trimming whitespace or rounding decimal values. The source definition editor supports you in this process with content completion and syntax highlighting. The **Change data type** controls helps you to define a function which changes the data type of the source definition. For example, the source definition is of type VARCHAR and corresponding values are always either true or false. Then you can select Boolean in the **Change data type** dropdown box to define a function which casts the VARCHAR values to BOOLEAN. Different target data types are available in the control, with some of them having options for dealing with non-matching values. For example, if you want to cast all values to type INTEGER and the non-matching literal N/A is processed, you can configure the casting function to use value 0 instead. If you have selected a data type you want to change to, click **Apply** to apply or **Cancel** to revert that type change. Note that functions you can apply to the source definition are not limited to the data type change functions provided under **Change data type**. In the source definition editor you can apply all SQL functions supported by Dremio, as listed under [SQL Function Categories](https://docs.dremio.com/software/sql-reference/sql-functions/).

If you want to derive additional result columns from nested content, you can specify the nested fields using the prefix "src." and the path to the nested field. For example, if you have a top-level field "someField" with a nested field "someSubField", add "src.someField.someSubField" as additional result column. In the same way you can access nested arrays. If you have a top-level field "someField" with a nested array field "someArraySubField", add "src.someField.someArraySubField[0]" as additional result column to access the first array entry.

<img src="/images/datahub-guide/datahub-add-addtl-col.png" alt="Add additional result column" style="max-width: 100%">

Click **Save** to add the column, which will be selected for offloading by default. If the source definition is invalid, for example when accessing an unknown column, you get an error message like *Column "UnknownColumn" not found in any table*. You must fix the source definition before you can proceed. Click **Cancel** to cancel the configuration of the additional result column.

**Edit an additional result column**

In the context menu of an additional result column, select **Edit** to open the dialog for editing the column name and the source definition. Click **Save** to update the column with the new settings. The column name must be unique and the source definition must be valid in order to proceed. Click **Cancel** to quit editing the column.

For auto-detected columns the source definition cannot be modified. If you want to modify the source definition, you must duplicate the auto-detected column and modify the source definition as required.

**Duplicate an additional result column**

In the context menu of an additional result column, select **Duplicate** to open the dialog for duplicating the column. The source definition of the duplicate column is the same as of the original column and can be adapted to your needs. The new column name initially uses the original column name plus a counter suffix to make the name unique. You can change the name as required. You can also rename the original column. New as well as original column name must be unique.

Click **Save** to complete and **Cancel** to quit duplicating the column.

A common use-case for duplication is to change the data type of an auto-detected column. For example, duplicate the column "statusOrdinal" and apply the corresponding casting function in the source definition editor. Use as new column name "statusOrdinal" and rename the original column to "statusOrdinal_Old". In the additional columns list select "statusOrdinal" and deselect "statusOrdinal_Old".

**Delete an additional result column**

In the context menu of an additional result column, select **Delete** to open the dialog for deleting the column. Click **Confirm** to proceed or **Cancel** to cancel the deletion. Auto-detected columns cannot be deleted.

When deleting an additional result column, the data will no longer be included in the next offloading run. Data which has already been offloaded to the data lake is not affected by the deletion of the column. Thus, the column itself will still be present in the data lake, but will have value NULL once the additional result column has been deleted.

Click **Next** to proceed with the next configuration step. Click **Previous** to go back one configuration step. Click **Cancel** to cancel the offloading configuration.


#### Set filter predicate {#set-filter-predicate}

Optionally you can define a filter predicate. Per default, all entries in the base collection are offloaded to the data lake; you can use the predicate to filter out entries you do not want to persist in the data lake. For example, you can filter out invalid values or outliers. In the **Additional filter predicate** field, you can specify such a filter in SQL syntax. For example, for the alarms collection the filter might be `status='ACTIVE' AND severity='WARNING'` to only persist active alarms with a severe warning. The filter predicate functionality supports complex SQL statements, that is, a combination of `AND/OR`, clauses like `IN(...)` / `NOT IN(...)`, and functions such as `REGEXP_LIKE(text, 'MyText\S+')`.

In the filter predicate you can query all standard attributes of the base collection as well as the custom fields. The additional result columns defined in the previous configuration step cannot be accessed by their name in the filter predicate. You must use the source definition as defined in the corresponding column instead.

{{< c8y-admon-info >}}
For querying the attribute `id`, you must use `_id`. For examples on querying different attributes, see also [{{< product-c8y-iot >}} DataHub best practices](/datahub/working-with-datahub/#datahub-best-practices).
{{< /c8y-admon-info >}}

When defining an additional filter predicate, you can click **Validate** to validate your predicate. If the validation fails, you will get an error description. You must fix these errors before you can proceed.

Click **Next** to proceed with the next configuration step. Click **Previous** to go back one configuration step. Click **Cancel** to cancel the offloading configuration.

#### Set task details {#set-task-details}

The task configuration step includes the offloading task name and the description. The **Offloading task name** is an identifier for the offloading pipeline. It must have at minimum one non-whitespace character. Even though the task name does not have to be unique, it is advisable to use a unique name.

In the **Description** field, you can add a description for this offloading pipeline. The description is optional, but we recommend you to use it, as it provides additional information about the pipeline and its purpose.

Click **Next** to proceed with the next configuration step. Click **Previous** to go back one configuration step. Click **Cancel** to cancel the offloading configuration.

#### Configure additional settings and complete configuration {#configure-additional-settings}

The final step provides a summary of your settings, the configuration of additional settings, and a result preview. The summary includes the settings from the previous steps as well as the internal UUID of this configuration. The UUID is generated by the system and cannot be modified. With the UUID you can distinguish configurations having the same task name, for example, when browsing the audit log or the offloading status. In the summary, you also get the schedule with which the offloading pipeline will be executed once it is started, for example, "every hour at minute 6". With the **Inactive**/**Active** toggle at the end of the summary you select whether the periodic offloading execution should be activated upon save or not.  

In the offloading preview you can inspect how the actual data will be stored in the data lake. For this purpose, an offloading preview is executed, returning a sample of the resulting data. The header row of the sample data incorporates the column name as well as the column type. Use **Hide time columns** to either show the default columns with a temporal notion or not. Note that the preview does not persist data to the data lake.

**Offloading frequency**

Per default each active offloading pipeline is executed once an hour, at the same minute. You can adapt the offloading frequency by setting in the dropdown box the hours per day at which the offloading will to be executed. As with the default setting, the exact minute of the hour for the execution is selected by the system. The hours are defined with respect to UTC as timezone. You have to select at least one hour; otherwise the configuration cannot be saved.

**Compaction strategy**

In the additional settings, you can define the compaction strategy for the offloading pipeline. The compaction strategy refers to how {{< product-c8y-iot >}} DataHub automatically combines multiple smaller files in the data lake into one or more larger files. {{< product-c8y-iot >}} DataHub periodically executes the compaction for an offloading pipeline as a large number of small files may adversely affect the query performance. The compaction is executed once per day; the compaction schedule cannot be modified.

{{< product-c8y-iot >}} DataHub automatically sets the compaction strategy, but allows you to optionally change the strategy. Available compaction strategies are:

- **Monthly & daily compaction:** {{< product-c8y-iot >}} DataHub selects for each day all files in the data lake which contain data from that day. These files will be combined into one or more larger files containing all data for this day. Additionally, all days for one month are combined into one or more larger files containing all data for this month. This results in summary files for each day and for each month, while the original files are deleted.
- **Daily compaction:** {{< product-c8y-iot >}} DataHub selects for each day all files in the data lake which contain data from that day. These files will be combined into one or more larger files containing all data for this day. This results in summary files for each day, while the original files are deleted.
- **No compaction:** Compaction is disabled. This setting is not recommended and must be used with caution as it has most likely negative impact on the query performance.

You can change the compaction strategy of an already running offloading pipeline by deactivating the pipeline, editing the compaction strategy, and reactivating the pipeline. If a compaction was already executed in the past, changing the compaction strategy does not revert the previous compaction results.

**View materialization**

In the additional settings, you can enable/disable view materialization for an offloading pipeline based on the alarms, events, or inventory collection. For these three collections, additional views over the target table are defined in the tenant’s space in Dremio. The *_latest* view maintains the latest status of all entities, excluding intermediate transitions of an entity. For large tables, the maintenance of the view might adversely affect overall performance. For that reason, the *_latest* view can be materialized so that the latest state of each entity will be persisted in the data lake. If that setting is activated for a pipeline, the materialized view will be created with the next offloading run and updated for each subsequent run. If you deactivate the setting for a pipeline, the view is still available, but no more materialized.

{{< c8y-admon-info >}}
When view materialization is activated, additional data is stored in the data lake, which might affect your storage costs.
{{< /c8y-admon-info >}}

**Duplicate column names**

Another setting, which applies only for the measurements collection, is the handling of duplicate column names. During offloading, measurement values are transformed into a relational format. Corresponding column names of measurement values are constructed by concatenating path and unit/value. This may lead to columns having the same name except for their case. Then the entries would all be offloaded into the same column. As this may be an unwanted behaviour in the offloading process, the names can be sanitized. When activated, for each generated column name, which would be equal to another column name in terms of case-insensitivity, a new column will be created, whose name includes the originally derived name plus a unique suffix.

The following two example documents from two different offloading runs would be processed as follows.

First document:
````json
{
    "id": "4711",
    ...
    "time": {
      "date": "2020-03-19T00:00:00.000Z",
      "offset": 0
    },
    "type": "c8y_Temperature",
    "_seriesValueFragments": [{
      "unit": "C",
      "value": 17.3,
      "path": "c8y_TemperatureMeasurement.T"
    }]
}
````

Second document:
````json
{
    "id": "4711",
    ...
    "time": {
      "date": "2020-03-20T00:00:00.000Z",
      "offset": 0
    },
    "type": "c8y_Temperature",
    "_seriesValueFragments": [{
      "unit": "C",
      "value": "NaN",
      "path": "c8y_temperaturemeasurement.T"
    }]
}
````

The two paths `c8y_TemperatureMeasurement.T` and `c8y_temperaturemeasurement.T` are equal in terms of case-insensitivity. Without name sanitization, only the column `c8y_TemperatureMeasurement.T.unit` will be created, which stores all unit entries. Analogously, one column `c8y_TemperatureMeasurement.T.value` will be created, which stores all value entries. In the latter case, the column would have a mixed type of DOUBLE and VARCHAR, which Dremio would then coerce to type VARCHAR for the column.


The first time an offloading run processes multiple fragments with the corresponding column names being equal with respect to case-insensitivity, the sanitization also generates distinct column names, with each name having a unique suffix.

##### Raising alarms {#raising-alarms}

Offloading as well as compaction runs may fail due to various reasons such as network issues, timeouts etc. As described in [History per offloading pipeline](/datahub/working-with-datahub/#history-per-offloading-job) and [History of compactions per offloading pipeline](/datahub/working-with-datahub/#history-compaction-per-offloading-job), the offloading and compaction job histories provide details for successful and failed runs. Additionally, an alarm can be raised within the {{< product-c8y-iot >}} platform in case of a failure. Such an alarm is available in the {{< product-c8y-iot >}} [Device management application](/device-management-application/monitoring-and-controlling-devices/#working-with-alarms).

Under **Create alarm on** you can activate raising alarms for offloading as well as compaction failures. Per default, the setting is activated for offloading and deactivated for compaction failures. When activated and an offloading run fails, an alarm is raised. If the offloading fails multiple times in a row, the associated alarm is updated with each new failure. The more successive runs fail, the higher the severity of the alarm will be, ranging from warning up to critical. Each alarm comprises information which offloading pipeline has failed and how often it has failed in a row. The same applies to alarms being raised for compaction failures.

The alarm will be active until it is cleared. The latter is the case when either an offloading run completes successfully, or the offloading configuration is deleted. Then, the active alarm is cleared, no matter if the alarms setting is activated or not. The alarm remains active if the offloading is unscheduled or raising alarms is deactivated. Again, the same applies to alarms being raised for compaction failures.

##### Dealing with mixed types {#mixed-types}

Each offloading pipeline must ensure that the columns of the result table in the data lake have a unique data type each. A mixed type situation occurs if an offloading run detects a data type not matching the expected column data type. For example, the type of a column is INTEGER. Then, the offloading processes the literal N/A, which is of type VARCHAR. To resolve such a mixed type constellation, you can either use the **Automatically evolve schema** or the **Stop pipeline** strategy.

**Automatically evolve schema**: This is the default strategy. The system automatically evolves the schema by introducing a new column for the data with a new type. The name of that column is the original column name plus the new data type as suffix. Each new value will from now on be stored in the new column, having the new type. In the job history of the pipeline the job having detected the mixed type is marked as successful.

**Stop pipeline**: The system stops the pipeline in order to allow for corrective actions like modifying the data or adapting the additional result columns. After those corrections you must manually re-activate the pipeline. In the job history of the pipeline the job having detected the mixed type is marked as erroneous.

When a mixed type constellation has been detected, an alarm will be additionally raised in the {{< product-c8y-iot >}} platform with further details like involved column and types. When schema evolution is selected, an alarm of type WARNING is raised. When pipeline stop is selected, an alarm of type CRITICAL is raised. Such an alarm is always raised, independent of the configuration for raising alarms as described in the previous section. The alarm must be manually cleared. It is only automatically cleared if the offloading pipeline is deleted.

For more details on data modeling and mixed types see also [Aligning data modeling and offloading](/datahub/working-with-datahub/#aligning-data-modeling-and-offloading).

**Completing the offloading configuration**

Finally, click **Save** to save the offloading pipeline. Otherwise click **Cancel** to cancel the offloading configuration. You can also navigate back to adapt previous settings, using the **Previous** buttons.
