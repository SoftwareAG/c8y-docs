{{< product-c8y-iot >}} DataHub provides functionality to configure, manage, and execute offloading pipelines that extract and transform data from the Operational Store of {{< product-c8y-iot >}} and offload it to a data lake.

You need configuration or administration permissions to work with offloading pipelines. See [Defining {{< product-c8y-iot >}} DataHub permissions and roles](/datahub/setting-up-datahub#defining-permissions) for details.

### Basic functionality {#basic-functionality}

On the **Offloading** page you do the offloading management and monitoring tasks:

* Selecting a {{< product-c8y-iot >}} base collection to offload
* Defining and validating an offloading configuration
* Editing, copying, or deleting an offloading configuration
* Importing/exporting offloading configurations
* Scheduling or manually triggering offloading executions
* Viewing the history of offloading executions

### Offloading overview {#offloading-overview}

In the main panel of the **Offloading** page, you will find all pipelines as well as their current status.

In the action bar you have a search field to search for all offloading configurations whose task name, description, filter predicate, additional columns, or UUID contain the search string. You can use the **Active**/**Inactive** filter to show/hide configurations being active or inactive respectively. The action bar also provides buttons for adding an offloading configuration, reloading the list of configurations and their status, and importing/exporting configurations.

Below the action bar you find the current list of configurations.

#### Offloading list {#offloading-list}

Each offloading configuration provides the following information:

**Active**

The toggle shows the current job state and can be used to activate or deactivate an offloading job.

**Job name**

The name of the job refers to the task name as defined in the configuration process. The sort control allows for sorting by job name.

**Target table name**

The target table name refers to the target table in Dremio, with which the data offloaded by this offloading pipeline can be queried. The sort control allows for sorting by target table name.

**Offloading status**

The offloading status is empty if the offloading has not been executed yet. For running and completed executions the start time is shown and either a calendar icon for a scheduled execution or a user icon for a manually triggered execution. For a running execution the elapsed time is additionally shown. For a completed execution the failure/success status, the number of offloaded records and the runtime are shown as well. For running and completed executions clicking on the offloading status navigates you to the detail view for that execution in the job history.

The sort control allows for sorting by successful/failed jobs. The filter control allows for filtering by execution status.

**Compaction status**

The compaction status is empty if the offloading has not been executed yet. If the compaction has been executed, the status of the most recent run is shown. This includes the execution time and whether the execution was successful or not, indicated by a success or failure icon. In case of a successful run, the runtime is shown as well. The sort control allows for sorting by successful/failed jobs. The filter control allows for filtering by execution status. The compaction status is only available for users with administration permissions.

**Additional information**

When expanding a configuration, the job schedule, the additional columns, and the filter predicate are shown as well as additional information. This includes links that allow you to explore the table and views associated with this offloading configuration in the Dremio UI. The links are available if the pipeline has been executed at least once.

**Context menu**

In the context menu of a configuration you find controls for managing the offloading process as described in more detail in the next sections.
