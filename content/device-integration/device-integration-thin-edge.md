thin-edge.io is an open-source project to provide a cloud-agnostic edge framework.
It is much more generic than the device management agent, so it can connect to multiple IoT cloud platforms, and it allows flexible logic being executed on the device.
It is optimized for a very small footprint and high performance.

To learn more about device integration using thin-edge.io, refer to [thin-edge.io - The open edge framework for lightweight IoT devices](https://thin-edge.io/).

### thin-edge.io on a device

Follow the tutorial [Getting started with thin-edge.io](https://thin-edge.github.io/thin-edge.io/start/getting-started/) to get an overview of the installation and configuration of thin-edge.io.

As a sample device, a Raspberry Pi can be used. The Raspberry Pi is a relatively simple and cheap yet powerful device. This makes it ideal for testing and trying out as well as some production use cases.

This tutorial explains in small steps to reach the goal of sending data to Cumulocity IoT and performing some additional device management tasks.


### thin-edge.io on a Revolution Pi

Refer to [Getting started with thin-edge.io on a RevPi from Kunbus]({{< link-sag-tech-forum >}}t/getting-started-with-thin-edge-io-on-a-revpi-from-kunbus/257475) for a tutorial on how to install thin-edge.io on a Revolution Pi from by Kunbus.

The Revolution PI is an open, modular and cost-effective industrial PC based on the well-known Raspberry Pi.
Housed in a slim DIN rail case, the three available base modules can be seamlessly expanded with a variety of matching I/O modules and fieldbus gateways.

Kunbus got their {{< product-c8y-iot >}} device management certification and is listed as a partner within the Device Catalog of [certified devices](https://devicepartnerportal.softwareag.com/devices?search=kunbus&page=1).

You can get more information about Kunbus and the Revolution Pi on the [Revolution PI website](https://revolutionpi.de/).
