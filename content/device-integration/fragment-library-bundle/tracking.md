The **Tracking** tab allows the device's path to be visualized. To achieve this the device must periodically send tracking events and update its position.

### Tracking position history {#tracking-position-history}

A device may upload its current or past positions as location updated events with the ```c8y_Position``` fragment. This is useful for tracking devices on a route or generally tracing the location history of devices.

```http
POST /event/events
```
```json
{
    "c8y_Position": {
    	"alt": 67,
      "lng": 6.95173,
      "lat": 51.151977
    },
    "time":"2013-06-22T17:03:14.000+02:00",
    "source": {
    	"id": "10300"
     },
    "type": "c8y_LocationUpdate",
    "text": "LocUpdate"
}
```

**SmartREST example**

{{< product-c8y-iot >}} provides the 401 static template to send location update events using SmartREST:

`401,51.151977,6.95173,67,2013-06-22T17:03:14.000+02:00`

### Setting the current position {#setting-the-current-position}

The current device position is represented using the ```c8y_Position``` fragment in the device’s own managed object.

```http
PUT /inventory/managedObjects/<deviceId>
```
```json
{
    "c8y_Position": {
    	"alt": 67,
      "lng": 6.95173,
      "lat": 51.151977
    }
}
```

|Field|DataType|Mandatory|Details|
|----|----|----|----|
|alt|number|No|Optional altitude of the device position in meters|
|lng|number|Yes|Longitude of the device position in degrees|
|lat|number|Yes|Latitude of the device position in degrees|

**SmartREST example**

Devices may update their current position using the 112 static template:

`112,51.151977,6.95173,67,`


In {{< product-c8y-iot >}} tracking over time is done using events and the current position is represented as fragment in the device's own managed object (see above for details). In practice devices usually determine their current position in an interval and upload the coordinates as they are measured. In this case the current position and the position at that time are the same and can be uploaded at the same time using 402 static template.

`402,51.151977,6.95173,67,,`
