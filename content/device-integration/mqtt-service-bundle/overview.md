MQTT Service is the new MQTT endpoint implementation of {{< product-c8y-iot >}} which provides the following benefits:

* Support for publishing and subscribing arbitrary payloads on any MQTT topic. The topics that are used by the existing {{< product-c8y-iot >}} MQTT implementation are not permitted for use with MQTT Service.
* Support for subscribing to the data stream from MQTT Service and mapping it to {{< product-c8y-iot >}} compatible one or routing them to a different service.
* Multi-tenancy support: A single endpoint serves multiple tenants.
* Full horizontal scalability.

This section does not describe the basics of MQTT communication. If you are unfamiliar with MQTT, we recommend 
you to consult one of the numerous introductions on the internet. Some references can be found on the [MQTT website](https://mqtt.org/mqtt-specification/).

### Requirements {#requirements}

MQTT Service is in final stages of development now, available as a private preview only. Please reach out to [product support](/additional-resources/contacting-support/) if interested.

### Architecture {#architecture}

MQTT Service works together with the Messaging Service to provide a framework for highly customizable and flexible MQTT message processing solutions.
The diagram below illustrates how a message flows, starting from the device, through the Messaging Service, 
then to the microservice where it is converted to the final {{< product-c8y-iot >}} REST request.

All MQTT messages coming to MQTT Service are forwarded to the Messaging Service, where they are persisted, waiting to be consumed.
A custom microservice that understands the topic and payload structure can, with the help of [Java Client](/device-integration/mqtt-service#java-client), 
consume the MQTT messages, translate them to the {{< product-c8y-iot >}} format, and then use the [Microservice SDK](/microservice-sdk/java) to push them into {{< product-c8y-iot >}}.

Similarly, messages can be sent to devices, as shown in the diagram below.

![MQTT Service push](/images/mqtt-service/mqtt-service-push.svg)

Like with the message coming from the device the same solution can be also applied when trying to communicate with the device.
Given the MQTT client ID and the topic, a microservice can push any MQTT message to a device via [Java Client](/device-integration/mqtt-service#java-client).

### MQTT Service vs {{< product-c8y-iot >}} MQTT {#mqtt-service-vs-cumulocity-iot-mqtt}

The table below presents a basic comparison between the standard {{< product-c8y-iot >}} MQTT functionality and that of MQTT Service.
