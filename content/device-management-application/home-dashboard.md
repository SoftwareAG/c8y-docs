The Home screen of the Device management application is a dashboard which shows data for the tenant.

![Home dashboard](/images/users-guide/DeviceManagement/device-management-home-screen.png)

The data shown on the Home dashboard is shared by all users of the tenant. By default, the Home dashboard includes recent alarms and quick links.
The Home dashboard can be edited and designed individually according to your needs. You can add, remove or change widgets which are displayed here.

For details on editing a dashboard, refer to [Working with dashboards](/cockpit/dashboards).
The Device management application dashboard works just like the Cockpit dashboard.

To reset the Home dashboard to its default, click **Restore dashboard** at the right of the top menu bar.
