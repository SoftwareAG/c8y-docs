The Device Management application lets you monitor the data that your devices send about the services they are running.

The [Services](/device-management-application/viewing-device-details/#services) tab on the device details view provides an overview of the services running on a given device and acts as an entry point to the service details view.
There you can see detailed information about measurements, events and alarms sent for every service.
