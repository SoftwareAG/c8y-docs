You have two options for creating assets in the DTM application.
The following section describes how to create an asset via the UI.
Alternatively, see [Creating assets via bulk import](/dtm/asset-hierarchy/#creating-assets-bulk-import) on how to import assets in bulk into the DTM application.

### To create an asset {#to-create-an-asset}

To add an asset via the UI:

1. Click **Add asset** in the top right corner of the **Assets** page.

2. In the **New asset** page, select the desired asset model from the **Choose asset model** dropdown menu on the top left.

    {{< c8y-admon-info>}}
The asset models here are root asset models.
They are labeled "START NODE" in the hierarchy.
Root asset models are asset models which are at the top of hierarchy and don't have any parent asset model above them.
    {{< /c8y-admon-info>}}

3. The asset hierarchy is shown in the left section and the respective dialog window is shown on the right. Fill out the fields labeled "required".

4. Optionally, add a description or [assign devices](#to-assign-devices-to-an-asset) to your root asset.

5. To add more than one root asset, click **Add**.

6. Under **Asset properties**, fill in the required information. Here you find all [asset properties](/dtm/asset-types/#asset-properties) assigned to the asset model that you create.

For an asset with a location property click Choose on Map in the section to set the values for latitude and longitude using map view. Click the full screen icon at the top right corner of the map to view it in full screen.

The marker is positioned at the default value set in the location property. If no defualt value is set,the marker is positioned at D&uuml;sseldorf, Germany. Click or drag the marker to the preferred position to select the value for latitude and longitude. The marker on the map is positioned at an approximated location when either latitude or longitude value is missing. To close the map view, click close above the map.

{{< c8y-admon-info>}}
The values of latitude and longitude are automatically updated whenever a new location is selected on the map and vice-versa. The Altitude value is not represented on the map.<br>
The asset properties are defined when [creating the asset model](/dtm/asset-types/#to-create-an-asset-model).
When creating an asset you must provide the values for all asset properties.
{{< /c8y-admon-info>}}

7. Click **Next** to reach the next hierarchy level of your **asset hierarchy** and fill out the fields as necessary for your asset. Repeat for all asset hierarchy levels.

8. The **Confirmation** step displays an overview of your asset and asset hierarchy levels. Click **Create** to create your asset. The asset is now listed in the **Assets** page.

As you define each hierarchy level of your new asset, you see a green check mark on each asset hierarchy level in the section on the left.

{{< c8y-admon-info>}}
If there are validation errors on the page, they are indicated by red highlights.
Correct the required information to continue.
If you are leaving the page abruptly, a confirmation dialogue box is shown.
{{< /c8y-admon-info>}}

![Adding a new asset](/images/dtm/assets/dtm-assets-new-asset.png)

**Example:**

If you are creating an asset hierarchy for the asset model "Wind turbine AZ-43Y", select the root asset model "Wind turbine AZ-43Y" in the **Choose asset model** dropdown menu. Starting with the root asset level, you see the dialog window "Wind turbine AZ-43Y" on the right.
Enter the name of the wind turbine in the field **Name**, for example, "SE-TURBINE-101".
In the field **Description** you can enter a brief description of this asset, for example, "Wind turbine with rated power of 3.6MW".
However, this field is optional and can be left empty.
To add more assets to this level, click **Add new** at the bottom.
Repeat until all desired assets on this level have been filled out.

Click **Next** to see the next asset level, for example, "Rotor".
Fill out all required fields.
You have the option to add more assets on this level.
Click **Next** to continue until all assets are created.

### To assign devices to an asset {#to-assign-devices-to-an-asset}

When you create a new asset you have the option of assigning one or more devices to this asset.

1. Click **Assign devices** in the **New asset** page.
2. The resulting dialog window lists all devices registered for the tenant. Select one or multiple devices and click **Assign**.
3. The dialog closes and you can continue creating the asset.

![Assigning devices to an asset](/images/dtm/assets/dtm-assets-assign-devices.png)

To add a new device, add it through the Device management application.
Refer to [Registering devices](/device-management-application/registering-devices/) for further information.

{{< c8y-admon-info>}}
Only select devices which are part of the current asset.
If a device belongs to a subasset, then select it when you create the subasset.
{{< /c8y-admon-info>}}

#### To filter and select devices {#to-filter-and-select-devices}

You can view, search or filter devices easily with the following options:

1. Columns in the grid specify the device details for each device. Click **Configure columns** at the top right to show or hide columns.

2. Click **Reload** to reload the page and display the latest list of devices present in the {{< product-c8y-iot >}} tenant.

3. Click **Sort** on the applicable columns to view the device data in either ascending or descending order.

4. To filter devices based on text, use the **Filter** option in the applicable columns. If you apply a filter, you see a notification at the top.

5. To clear the filters, click **Clear all filters**. To see the sort icon and the filter icons hover over each column.

### To add multiple instances of an asset {#to-add-multiple-instances-of-an-asset}

At each hierarchy level, you can create multiple assets from a single asset model.

**Example:**

For a wind turbine rotor with three blades, you first create the asset hierarchy level for "Rotor". Then use the asset model "Blade" to add the blades.

1. Click **Add** at the bottom to add more blade assets.

    ![Adding multiple assets](/images/dtm/assets/dtm-assets-add-multiple-instance.png)

2. To delete an added asset template, click the delete icon at the top right.

3. Modify the assets by navigating the asset pages using the **Previous** and **Next** buttons. You can track your progress via the green check marks in the asset hierarchy on the left.

4. When done, the **Confirmation** page shows the asset hierarchy. Click **Create** to create the asset hierarchy.

![Confirmation page asset creation](/images/dtm/assets/dtm-assets-confirmation-page.png)

On successful asset hierarchy creation, you see a pop-up notification in the top right corner.
You can view the newly created asset hierarchy in the **Assets** page.
Also see [viewing assets](/dtm/asset-hierarchy/#viewing-assets).

### To view asset details {#to-view-asset-details}

Select an asset in the **Assets** page to view the asset details in **Subassets** tab.
It shows all the subassets, child devices and asset properties.

In the top right corner of the **Subassets** tab, you can [assign devices](#to-assign-devices-to-an-asset).

![Subassets](/images/dtm/assets/dtm-assets-subassets-page.png)

You can view the hierarchy of the asset in the **Asset tree** tab. Initially the asset hierarchy is collapsed. Click the expand icon to view the next level of subassets.

Click **Add asset** to add more subassets or click **Import assets** to add [assets in bulk](/dtm/asset-hierarchy/#creating-assets-bulk-import).

![Asset tree](/images/dtm/assets/dtm-assets-asset-tree-page.png)

#### To add subassets {#to-add-subassets}

To add subassets to an asset open the **Asset tree** tab.

1. Click **Add asset** to load the **Asset hierarchy** for the selected asset.

2. The root asset is displayed with the label "parent node". The asset hierarchy displayed below, is a subset of the root asset hierarchy.

    ![Subasset](/images/dtm/assets/dtm-assets-add-child-asset.png)

**Example:**

If "Wind turbine" is a root level asset, then "Rotor" is a subasset of "Wind turbine" and "Blade" is a subasset of "Rotor".
If you navigate to the **Asset tree** page of "Wind turbine" and click **Add asset**, the asset hierarchy loads for "Rotor" and "Blade".

If you navigate to the existing "Rotor" asset and want to add a subasset, you can only add subassets for "Blade".

For details on how to add assets in the asset hierarchy, see [To create an asset](#to-create-an-asset).

{{< c8y-admon-info>}}
If you are at the end of the hierarchy, you see no further option to create subassets.
{{< /c8y-admon-info>}}
