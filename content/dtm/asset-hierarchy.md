  content: "To create an asset, use asset models as the blueprint, which consist of one or more asset properties as well as one or more child asset models.  


  An asset hierarchy consist of a root asset model followed by all its subsequent child asset models. Each hierarchy level can consist of asset properties for the asset, as well as its subassets and devices.


  To get started, open the **Configuration** menu in the navigator and create the necessary asset models and asset properties in the **Asset models** and **Asset properties** pages respectively. Afterwards, navigate back to the **Assets** menu in the navigator and click **Add asset** on the top right corner to create the assets."
