Asset properties are the parameters that define an [asset model](#asset-models). One or more asset properties are used to define an asset model. Asset properties are created in the **Asset properties** page.

When you open the DTM application, default properties are readily available for use. See [Default properties](#default-properties) to view the list of properties available.

### To create an asset property {#to-create-an-asset-property}

When you navigate to the **Asset properties** page following **Configuration > Asset properties** for the first time, there will be no asset properties present in the system except the default properties. See [Default properties](#default-properties) to view the list of properties available.

If you use a tenant which already has asset properties defined, you find the list of defined asset properties on the left. You see the selected asset property definition on the right.

To create an asset property, click **Add asset property** on the bottom left. Enter the required data in the form (see description below) and click **Save**.

Use the Export asset properties and Import asset properties feature to transfer asset properties between tenants. This is useful for replicating the asset properties in multiple tenants. By exporting and importing properties, you can ensure consistency and reduce the time and effort required for manual configuration. See [To export asset properties](#to-export-asset-properties) and [To import asset properties](#to-import-asset-properties) on how to export or import asset properties.

</tbody>
</table>

{{< c8y-admon-info>}}
The **Default value** field is only shown if the selected **Type** is either "Text" or "Number".
{{< /c8y-admon-info>}}

Once you have defined all necessary asset properties for your project, you must define the [asset models](/dtm/asset-types/#asset-models).

### Asset property types {#asset-property-types}

To further define the asset property you can select one of the six following options listed under **Type**:

#### Text {#text}

Select **Text** if the asset property value is a string, for example, a wind turbine manufacturer name. Enter a valid text.

 If you select **Text**, the following fields appear:

* **Min Length**:

Enter the minimum length of the text that must be provided for this asset property during the asset creation. Any text below the minimum length is not accepted.

* **Max Length**:

Enter the maximum length of the text that must be provided for this asset property during the asset creation. Any text above the maximum length is not accepted.

* **RegExp**:

Enter a valid regular expression. During the asset creation, you must provide the asset property value, which adheres to the regular expression.

**Example:**

If the asset property is "Generator code" with the regular expression "^MCGEN[a-zA-Z0-9]*$", all generator codes must start with the prefix “MCGEN”.

If you do not select any of the restrictions above, it is not applicable for the asset property during asset creation.

#### Default value {#default-value}

Assigns a default value to the asset property. If this field is left empty in the asset property and marked as required in the asset model, you must enter a value during the asset creation.

{{< c8y-admon-info>}}
The default value must adhere to all validations provided beforehand. If you selected a property of the type "Text", you can set the **Min length**, **Max length** and/or **RegExp** and the default value must fulfill all set validations.
{{< /c8y-admon-info>}}

**Example:**

If the asset property is "Generator code" with a **Min length** of 8, a **Max length** of 20 and the **RegExp** defined as "^MCGEN[a-zA-Z0-9]*$", the default value must fulfill all of these three criteria. If it does not, this results in a validation error. The respective field will be highlighted to modify its content to fit the criteria.

#### Number {#number}

For this type you must provide a numeric value for the asset creation, for example, the height of a wind turbine tower.

The type **Number** contains the following fields for additional information:

* **Minimum**:

If selected, enter a number in the field **Minimum** on the right. When you create the asset, the asset property value cannot be lower or less than provided in the field.

{{< c8y-admon-info>}}

If you entered a [default value](/dtm/asset-types/#default-value) beforehand, it must be greater than or equal to the value provided in the field **Minimum.** By default, this box is not selected.

{{< /c8y-admon-info>}}

* **Maximum**:

If selected, enter a number in the field on the right. When you create the asset, the asset property value cannot exceed the **Maximum** provided.

{{< c8y-admon-info>}}

If you entered a [default value](/dtm/asset-types/#default-value) beforehand, it must be lesser than or equal to the **Maximum** entered here. By default, this box is not checked.

{{< /c8y-admon-info>}}

* **Default value**:
Assigns a default value to the asset property. If this field is left empty in the asset property and marked as required in the asset model, you must enter a value during the asset creation.

{{< c8y-admon-info>}}

If the **Minimum** and/or **Maximum** is checked, the given **Default value** is validated against one or both of these values.

{{< /c8y-admon-info>}}

**Example:**

If the asset property is "Tower height" with a **Minimum** of 80 and a **Maximum** of 110, the **Default value** must be between 80 and 110.

#### Date Picker {#date-picker}

If selected, you must select a date from the calendar displayed in the dialog window during the asset creation.

**Example:**

If "Installation date" is a property of the "Wind turbine" asset, then you must select the installation date of the wind turbine when creating the asset.

#### Enumeration {#enumeration}

Select **Enumeration** to list several values that apply to this asset property.

If selected, a second field appears below. Here, enter all desired information separated by a comma.

During asset creation, these values appear as options in the dropdown menu. Select one of the options to initialize the asset property with that option.

**Example:**

If you create an asset property for a wind turbine "drivetrain type" and the type must be either Gearbox or Direct-drive, you must provide these options separated by a comma when creating the asset property.

![Asset property enumeration](/images/dtm/custom-property/dtm-property-library-type-enum.png)

#### Boolean {#boolean}

If selected, the presence of the asset property can either be true or false during the asset creation.

An asset with this asset property shows a checkbox. Selecting this checkbox sets the asset property value to true.

**Example:**

If you create an asset property called "Yaw system" to identify wind turbines that rotate towards the wind direction during upwind conditions, the asset property must be created with the type "Boolean". When you create an asset for a wind turbine with a yaw system present, it is then initialized to "true". If there is no yaw system present, the asset is initialized to "false".

#### File upload {#file-upload}

This option allows you to upload a file during the asset creation.

{{< c8y-admon-req >}}
ROLES & PERMISSIONS

- To add/update files: CREATE/ADMIN permission for permission type "Inventory"
{{< /c8y-admon-req >}}

If selected, enter the allowed file types separated by a comma in the **Allowed file types** field. Provide the maximum file size for uploads in the **Max file size in MB** field. When you create an asset with this asset property, you can only upload files that adhere to the allowed file types with their file size not exceeding the set limit.

{{< c8y-admon-info>}}

If there is a file size limit set for the tenant, you see the limit along with the field name for **Max file size in MB**.<br>
During the bulk import, the file size validation is skipped as the file is already uploaded to the tenant.
To prevent security threats, sanitize your files beforehand.

{{< /c8y-admon-info>}}

**Example:**

To upload the schematic diagram for a wind turbine, you name the asset property "Wind turbine schematic" and specify the file type of the schematic file. Then upload the respective file. Once the asset is created, you can view this file for future reference.

### To edit an asset property {#to-edit-an-asset-property}

1. Select the desired asset property in the **Asset properties** to see all the details on the right of the screen.
2. Edit any content of the asset property.
3. Click **Save** to save your changes.
4. If this property is used by any asset model, in the resulting confirmation dialog, select **Confirm** to continue to save your changes.

### To search and filter asset properties {#to-search-and-filter-asset-properties}

1. Navigate to the **Asset properties** page.
2. Enter the desired name in the search field on the top left.
3. Click the search icon <i class="dlt-c8y-icon-search icon-20"></i>.

All asset properties matching the search values are displayed on the screen on the left. If the search entry does not match with any asset properties, you see a notification.

### To delete an asset property {#to-delete-an-asset-property}

Select the respective asset property in the **Asset properties** and click **Delete** on the bottom right.

In the resulting confirmation dialog, click **Confirm** to continue.

{{< c8y-admon-info>}}

If the asset property you want to delete is part of an existing asset or an asset model, you see an error notification and the asset property is not deleted.

{{< /c8y-admon-info>}}

### Types of asset properties {#types-of-asset-properties}

There are two types of asset properties, both fulfill different requirements:

#### Simple asset property {#simple-asset-property}

A simple asset property consists of a single key value pair. This option is set by default when creating new asset properties.

In the **Asset properties** simple asset properties are listed with their type.

 **Example:**

 If the asset property is called "Tower height", you use the key "tower_height" with the Default value of "70" (see image below).

 ![Simple asset property](/images/dtm/custom-property/dtm-property-library-simple-custom-property.png)

#### Complex asset property {#complex-asset-property}

A complex asset property consists of multiple key-value pairs, meaning, it contains a root object followed by one or more key-value pairs. You can select the complex asset property option by switching on the toggle. If you switch on the toggle, you must define each key-value pair as well as providing a type for each pair. You can arrange the properties in the required order by dragging and dropping them. Hover over the row to see the drag icon. Click and drag the drag icon for reordering. You can expand all key-value pairs at a time using **Expand all**. Alternatively, you can expand each key-value pair to see a specific property. When you add a new key-value pair, it automatically expands.

In the **Asset properties** complex asset properties are listed with the label "Object".

You see the preview of data model on the right side of properties section.

 **Example:**

If the asset property is called "Gearbox specifications" with the key "gearbox_specifications", then power, speed increasing ratio and weight are the multiple key-value pairs defining the property "Gearbox specifications". Switch on the **Complex property** toggle (see image below). Enter the required information for all key-value pairs and click **Save**.

![Complex asset property](/images/dtm/custom-property/dtm-property-library-complex-property.png)

### To export asset properties {#to-export-asset-properties}

Follow the steps below:

1. On the **Asset properties** page, click **Export**. In the resulting dialog box, you see the list of asset properties along with their description and type.
2. Select one or more desired asset properties and click **Export**.
3. The dialog closes and a JSON file named 'Export-asset-properties.json' downloads.

Use the downloaded file to import the asset properties into a DTM application on another tenant.

{{< c8y-admon-info>}}
Default properties are not listed under **Export**. See [Default properties](#default-properties) to view the list of properties available.
You can export a maximum of 500 asset properties at a time.
{{< /c8y-admon-info>}}

![Export asset properties](/images/dtm/custom-property/dtm-property-library-export.png)

### To import asset properties {#to-import-asset-properties}

To import asset properties into the DTM application, follow the steps below:

1. On the **Asset properties** page, click **Import**.
2. Upload the JSON file in the drop file area of the resulting dialog. The JSON file is the file containing exported asset properties from a DTM application on another tenant.
3. Click **Next** to preview the asset properties before importing them.
4. Click **Import** to import the asset properties.
5. Alternatively, click **Back** to go to previous step. Hover over the file name and click the **Delete** icon to remove the current file and upload a different one.
6. View newly imported asset properties in the **Asset properties** page.

![Import asset properties](/images/dtm/custom-property/dtm-property-library-import.png)

{{< c8y-admon-info>}}
When you upload the JSON file, it undergoes validation. If the validation fails, you see a corresponding message in the dialog. Click **Download log file** to view the errors.
Review the errors that are reported, resolve them, and attempt the upload again.

You can import a maximum of 500 asset properties at a time.
{{</ c8y-admon-info>}}

### Default properties {#default-properties}

### Characteristics {#characteristics-of-default-properties}

* Default properties are readily available when you open the application.
* Default properties cannot be deleted.
* Only selected fields within a default property are editable and the editable fields vary depending on the specific property.
* Default properties cannot be exported.

### Location {#location}

The **Location** property enables you to assign location (latitude and longitude) to an asset. You can set the default values of the latitude and longitude by entering the corresponding values or alternatively using the map view.

To set the default values for the latitude and longitude using the map view, click **Choose on Map** at the end of the section. Click the full screen icon <i class="dlt-c8y-icon-resize-expand text-muted icon-20"></i> at the top right corner of the map to view it in full screen. Without values for latitude and longitude, the marker is hidden. To see the marker, click anywhere on the map. Click or drag the marker to the preferred position to select the default value for latitude and longitude.

{{<c8y-admon-info>}}
If a property with the label "Location" already exists, the default Location property will be created with the label "Asset Location" and with the key "c8y_Position".<br>
The valid range for the latitude is -90 to +90 and valid range for the longitude is -180 to +180. <br>
The marker on the map is only visible when both values for latitude and longitude are provided.<br>
The default values of both latitude and longitude are automatically updated whenever a new location is selected on the map and vice-versa. The Altitude value is not represented on the map.
{{</c8y-admon-info>}}
