Edge uses REST and MQTT as protocols for external communication. Both protocols may be used to interface devices with Edge. For more information, see [Device integration using REST](/device-integration/rest) and [SmartREST 2.0](/reference/smartrest-two/).

Additionally, Edge offers:

* OPC UA protocol. OPC UA protocols support through the OPC UA device gateway and OPC UA management service.

* Cloud Fieldbus functionality to collect data from fieldbus devices and remotely manage them. For example, Modbus protocol.
