The Edge operator operates within a namespace (default **c8yedge**, unless specified during the Edge operator installation). It creates and monitors multiple Kubernetes resources that collectively constitute the Edge.

You can deploy Edge on Kubernetes in two modes: one includes MongoDB, which is both deployed and managed by the Edge operator; the other involves connecting to an externally deployed MongoDB.

The deployment model is depicted below:
