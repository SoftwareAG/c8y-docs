This section defines the Edge deployment's configurations.

|<div style="width:150px">Field</div>|Required|<div style="width:115px">Type</div>|Default|Description|
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
|version|Yes|String| |Edge version to deploy.<br><br>For example, {{< c8y-edge-current-version >}}.0.0 for {{< c8y-edge-current-version-alt >}} and {{< c8y-edge-current-version >}}.0.1 for a fix-1 of {{< c8y-edge-current-version-alt >}}.
|domain|Yes|String||A fully qualified domain name. <p>For example, *myown.iot.com*. Here, you must have the Edge license for the domain name *iot.com* or *myown.iot.com*.
|licenseKey|Yes|String||Edge license key you received for the domain. <br>To request the license file for Edge, please contact the logistics team for your region:<p style="margin: 0; padding-left: 2em;">- North and South America: LogisSrvus@softwareagusa.com <p style="margin: 0; padding-left: 2em;">- All Other Regions: LogisticsServiceCenterGER@softwareag.com </p><br>In the email, you must include <p style="margin: 0; padding-left: 2em;">- Your company name, under which the license has been bought <p style="margin: 0; padding-left: 2em;">- The domain name (for example, myedge.domain.com), where Edge will be reachable</p><br>For more information, see [Domain name validation for Edge license key generation](/edge/edge-installation/#domain-name-validation-for-edge-license-key-generation).
|company|Yes|String||Name of the "edge" tenant, for example, the company's name.
|tlsSecretName| No|String|The Edge operator generates and assigns self-signed TLS/SSL private key and certificates.|Name of the Kubernetes secret containing the TLS/SSL private key and certificates for the domain name specified in the `spec.domain` field. This secret must contain two keys:<p style="margin: 0; padding-left: 2em;">- **tls.key:** TLS/SSL private key in the PEM format.<br>Use your internal or an external Certificate Authority (CA) to generate the TLS/SSL key and certificates. When ordering the TLS/SSL certificate, there is a Subject Alternative Name field that lets you specify additional host names (ie. sites, IP addresses, common names, etc.) to be protected by a single TLS/SSL certificate, such as a Multi-Domain (SAN) certificate. You should include the "edge" tenant and {{< management-tenant >}} domain names in SAN. If you plan to install {{< product-c8y-iot >}} DataHub, also include its domain name in the SAN. For example, if your domain name is *myown.iot.com*, include *myown.iot.com*, *management.myown.iot.com* and *datahub.myown.iot.com* domains in SAN field.</p><p style="margin: 0; padding-left: 2em;">- **tls.crt:** The TLS/SSL certificate chain associated with the private key in PEM format. It's essential to ensure the certificates are arranged in the correct sequence for TLS/SSL validation to succeed. The proper order of the certificate chain is:</p><p style="margin: 0; padding-left: 4em;">- **End-entity certificate:** This is the TLS/SSL certificate issued to your domain or server, sometimes referred to as the "leaf" or "server" certificate.</p><p style="margin: 0; padding-left: 4em;">- **Intermediate certificate(s):** These certificates link your end-entity certificate to the trusted root certificate. If there are multiple intermediate certificates, they must be ordered correctly as well.</p><p style="margin: 0; padding-left: 4em;">- **Root CA certificate:** This is the certificate for the Certificate Authority (CA) that is trusted by browsers and other clients. It's generally included last in the chain.</p> <p><p>For more information, see [TLS/SSL Secret](#tls-secret).<p><p>**Info:** The Edge operator retrieves this secret from the **`EDGE-CR-NAMESPACE`**. Ensure that this secret is created before initiating the Edge deployment or update process.
|email|Yes|String||Email used for the admin user.
|cloudTenant|No|Structure||{{< product-c8y-iot >}} cloud tenant details to configure and manage Edge remotely. For more information, see [Cloud Tenant](/edge-kubernetes/edge-custom-resource-definition/#k8-edge-cloud-tenant).
|storageClassName|No|String||The Edge operator requests three PVCs, as outlined below.<p style="margin: 0; padding-left: 2em;">- 75 GB, PVC named `mongod-data-edge-db-rs0-0` made by MongoDB server for persisting application data. 75 GB is the default, and its value can be configured through the Edge CR field `spec.mongodb.resources.requests.storage`.</p><p style="margin: 0; padding-left: 2em;">- 10 GB, PVC named `microservices-registry-data` made by the private registry for persisting microservice images.</p><p style="margin: 0; padding-left: 2em;">- 5 GB, PVC named `edge-logs` made by the Edge logging component for persisting application and system logs.</p><br>Each of these PVCs utilizes the StorageClass if specified within the **`storageClassName`** field of the Edge CR.<p style="margin: 0; padding-left: 2em;">- In case you omit the **`storageClassName`**, the Edge operator requests PVCs without a StorageClass, thereby instructing Kubernetes to utilize the default StorageClass configured in the cluster.<p style="margin: 0; padding-left: 2em;">- If you explicitly specify an empty StorageClass as **`""`**, the Edge operator requests PVCs with an empty StorageClass, thereby instructing Kubernetes to carry out static provisioning.<p style="margin: 0; padding-left: 2em;">- Finally, if you specify the name of an existing StorageClass for which dynamic provisioning is enabled, the Operator requests PVCs with that class name, thereby instructing Kubernetes to utilize dynamic provisioning according to the specified class.<p><p>**Info:** This value is used only during the Edge installation and can’t be changed for existing installations.
|core|No|Structure||{{< product-c8y-iot >}} platform configurations. For more information, see [{{< product-c8y-iot >}} Core configurations](/edge-kubernetes/edge-custom-resource-definition/#c8y-core-config).
|mongodb|Yes|Structure||Configurations needed to deploy the MongoDB server managed by the Edge operator or connect to an external one. For more information, see [MongoDB](/edge-kubernetes/edge-custom-resource-definition/#k8-edge-mongodb).
|microservices| No|Array of Structure|The Edge operator deploys all the default {{< product-c8y-iot >}} microservices, which include the Apama, Smart Rules, OPCUA Management Server microservices.|Specify resources to allocate to each of the default {{< product-c8y-iot >}} microservices deployed. For more information, see [Microservices](/edge-kubernetes/edge-custom-resource-definition/#k8-edge-microservices).
