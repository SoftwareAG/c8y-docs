Configuring an email server enables you to receive email notifications about events, alarms, and also to reset your password. In case you forget the password, the {{< product-c8y-iot >}} Edge appliance mails you the password reset link to reset your password.

To configure the "reset password" template and email server settings, perform the following steps:

1. Log into the {{< management-tenant >}} using *https://&#60;tenant-domain>/apps/administration/index.html#/configuration*.

	- Username: management/<*{{< product-c8y-iot >}} Edge admin username*>
	- Password: password provided during the installation

2. Update the email server details and templates as mentioned in [Password reset](/enterprise-tenant/customization/#password-reset) and [Email server](/enterprise-tenant/customization/#email-server).
