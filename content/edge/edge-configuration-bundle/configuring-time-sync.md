For many use cases, and especially when using Apama, the time inside the Edge appliance must be synchronized with the network.

By default, the `chrony` service is responsible for time synchronization with the host operating system. For Hyper-V, the `chronyd` service is disabled by default for accurate time synchronization.

Once the time synchronization is enabled, you can specify the NTP servers and the interval to trigger the time synchronization.

### Configuring the time synchronization using the UI

1. Log in to the {{< management-tenant >}} using the Edge administrator credentials created during the installation.

   - Username: management/<*Edge admin username*>
   - Password: password provided during the installation
2. Switch to the Administration application using the application switcher at the right of the top bar **<img class="Default" src="/images/icons/switcher-icon.png" alt="icon" style="display: inline; float: none">**.
3. Click **Edge** > **Time synchronization** in the navigator.
4. Use the toggle button to enable the time synchronization.
5. Click **Edit** to specify the NTP servers and the interval to trigger the time synchronization.

### Configuring the time synchronization using the REST APIs

To configure the time synchronization, use the following endpoints:

- [POST /edge/configuration/time-sync](/edge/rest-api/#post-edgeconfigurationtime-sync)
- [GET /edge/configuration/time-sync](/edge/rest-api/#get-edgeconfigurationtime-sync)
