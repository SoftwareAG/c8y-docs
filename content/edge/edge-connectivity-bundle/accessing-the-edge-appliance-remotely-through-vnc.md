You can access the Edge appliance from the {{< product-c8y-iot >}} tenant by installing the VNC components on your Edge appliance. Ensure that you have registered your Edge appliance with the {{< product-c8y-iot >}} tenant. See [Registering the Edge appliance in the {{< product-c8y-iot >}} tenant](/edge/edge-connectivity/#registering-the-edge-appliance-in-the-cumulocity-iot-tenant).

VNC server does not work if SELinux is set to enforcing mode.

### Step 1: Installing the VNC components {#step-1-installing-the-vnc-components}

{{< c8y-admon-info >}}

The Edge appliance must be connected to the internet to install the VNC components.

{{< /c8y-admon-info >}}

1. Run the script *vnc-setup.sh*.

   `sudo /opt/c8y/utilities/vnc-setup.sh`

   The *vnc-setup.sh* script installs the VNC components. After installing the VNC components, you should configure the VNC server for each user.

2. After installing the VNC components, log in as a root user and add the *vnc-server* service to the *firewalld* firewall. For example, the following commands add the *vnc-server* to the *firewalld* with the zone set to public:

   `firewall-cmd --zone=public --permanent --add-service=vnc-server`

   `firewall-cmd --reload`

    {{< c8y-admon-info >}}These are sample commands and may vary based on your requirements.{{< /c8y-admon-info >}}

### Step 2: Configuring VNC server for a user {#step-2-configuring-vnc-server-for-a-user}

To configure the VNC server, run the *vnc-user-setup.sh* script. Each user should run this script to set up VNC components and be able to connect to the Edge appliance. The *vnc-user-setup.sh* script enables the current user to use VNC functionality and set a VNC password for the current user.

1. Run the script *vnc-user-setup.sh*.

   `/opt/c8y/utilities/vnc-user-setup.sh`

2. Provide and verify the password.

3. Select **Y** or **N** to enter a view-only password.

    Record the allocated port number. This port number will be used to connect to the VNC server on your Edge appliance.
{{< c8y-admon-info >}}
You can also get the allocated port number from the */opt/c8y/utilities/vnc-display-mapping* file. In this file, you will find the VNC display number allocated for each user. For example, admin:1. You must add 5900 to the number associated with the user. In this example, the port number for the user **admin** is 5901.

### Step 3: Connecting to the Edge appliance using VNC {#step-3-connecting-to-the-edge-appliance-using-vnc}

To access and connect to the Edge appliance:

1. In the {{< product-c8y-iot >}} tenant for your registered Edge appliance, add a remote access endpoint. See [To add a remote access endpoint via VNC](/cloud-remote-access/using-cloud-remote-access/#to-add-a-remote-access-endpoint-via-vnc). You must use the same port number that is allocated for you.

2. Connect to the endpoint. See [To connect to an endpoint](/cloud-remote-access/using-cloud-remote-access/#to-connect-to-an-endpoint).

The connection to the Edge appliance is established and the UI appears for the Edge appliance. Right-click in the screen to open the desktop components **xterm** and **firefox**.

{{< c8y-admon-important >}}
Do not use the **Send Ctrl+Alt+Del** button in the VNC interface. If you do so, you will lose the VNC connection and not be able to reconnect until you restart the Edge appliance.
{{< /c8y-admon-important >}}

### Changing the VNC password {#changing-the-vnc-password}

You can change the VNC password for the current user by running the *vnc-user-setup.sh* script. After changing the password, you must update the password in the remote access endpoint.
