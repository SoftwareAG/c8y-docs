### Monitoring the measurements of the Edge VM

You can monitor the measurements like usage of disk space, RAM, CPU, disk I/O, network of the Edge VM in your Cumulocity IoT tenant. For more information about disk space monitoring, see [Working with Cumulocity IoT Edge > Monitoring the measurements](/edge/usage/#monitoring_edge_metrics).

### Expanding disk space

You can also increase the disk space of the installation disk. For more information, see [Setting up Cumulocity IoT Edge > Configuration > Expand disk size](/edge/installation/#expanding-the-disk-size).

### Updating Docker Bridge Network CIDR

You can update the Docker Bridge Network CIDR  while configuring the Cumulocity IoT Edge network. For more information about changing the Docket IP, see [Setting up Cumulocity IoT Edge > Configuration > Configure network](/edge/installation/#configuring-the-edge-network).

### Changing the hostname

You can change the hostname of your Edge VM from the default hostname 'server'. For more information, see [Setting up Cumulocity IoT Edge > Setting up the environment > Changing the hostname](/edge/installation/#changing-the-hostname).

### Support for Internet Explorer

In response to the end of life announcement by Microsoft for Internet Explorer 11, Cumulocity IoT Edge 10.7 will be the last release that supports Internet Explorer 11. With the upcoming releases, Cumulocity IoT Edge continues to support the latest version of the Microsoft Edge browser.

|CIE-852|VMware Workstation|**Issue:** On VMware Workstation, you should use UTC on your host machine. If you choose not to use UTC, you may have time sync issues.<br><br>**Workaround:** Set `rtc.diffFromUTC=0` in the .vmx file.
|CIE-1232|Disk Management|**Limitation:** <ul><li>The data disk can only be expanded three times.</li><li>The installation disk can only be expanded two times.</li></ul>
|CIE-670|Device Management|**Issue:** The default linux-agent created in VMware appears as **VMware None (linux-agent)**.<br><br>**Workaround:** Change the name of the linux-agent in the Device Management application.
|CIE-1716|Edge agent|**Issue:** The *edge-agent* service does not start after performing the post-upgrade process.<br><br>**Workaround:** <ul><li>Log in as **admin** user and start the service using the command:<br>`sudo systemctl start edge-agent`</li><li>To start the service automatically at startup, enable the service using the command: `sudo systemctl enable edge-agent`
|CIE-1102|VNC|**Issue:** The VNC installation and user configuration is lost when you upgrade the Edge VM.<br><br>**Workaround:** Install and configure the VNC components. See [Connecting to the cloud > Accessing the Edge device remotely through VNC > Installing the VNC components](/edge/usage/#step-1-installing-the-vnc-components).
|CIE-1717|Remote access endpoint|**Issue:** After upgrading the Edge VM, the SSH host public key gets updated, disabling the existing SSH based remote access endpoint.<br><br>**Workaround:** Edit the existing remote access endpoint and update the host key with the new key. The new key is available at */etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key.pub*.
|CIE-1469|Microservices|**Issue:** Uploading the Device Simulator microservice fails intermittently, due to which the microservice hosting feature is enabled with warnings.<br><br>**Workaround:**<ol><li>Log in as **management/sysadmin** and add **Tenant management** to **admins** global roles.</li><li>Manually upload the Device Simulator microservice to the management tenant from */opt/edge/microservice-binaries/device-simulator-\*.zip*, and subscribe the Device Simulator to the **edge** tenant.</li><li>Log in to the **edge** tenant as **admin** user, and add **Simulator** to **admins** global roles.
