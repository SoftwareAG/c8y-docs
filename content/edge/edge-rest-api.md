For information about the REST APIs for {{< product-c8y-iot >}} Edge, see the [{{< openapi >}}](https://{{< domain-c8y >}}/api/edge/).

{{< c8y-admon-important >}}

Wherever possible, the REST resources and its representations are maintained in a *backwards compatible* manner. However, the Edge installation or configuration scripts developed based on the REST API of an older Edge version (for example, 10.9.0.0) may not work against the newer version (for example, 10.15.0.0). Also, the behavior of the REST API may change without prior notice if the existing behavior is incorrect or constitutes a security vulnerability.

This API is not covered by the general {{< product-c8y-iot >}} API backwards compatibility statement mentioned in [Compatibility policy](/concepts/introduction/#compatibility-policy).
