### Installation requirements

|Item|Details|
|:---|:---|
|**Hypervisor**|- VMWare ESXi 6.5 and 6.7 <br> - VMware Workstation Player 16.2 <br>- Hyper-V on Microsoft Windows 10 Enterprise, version 1809. The supported VM configuration version is 9.0.<br>**Important:** Ensure that you keep the virtualization platform updated and free from vulnerabilities by following the security advisories provided by the vendors of the hypervisor.
|**Edge appliance image**|To be downloaded from the [{{< company-sag >}} {{< sag-portal >}}]({{< link-sag-portal >}}), based on the target hypervisor. <br><br> For VMware (ESXi and Workstation Player), download all the 4 files:<br>- CumulocityIoTEdge-Appliance-*version*-VMware-disk1.vmdk<br>- CumulocityIoTEdge-Appliance-*version*-VMware-disk2.vmdk<br>- CumulocityIoTEdge-Appliance-*version*-VMware.mf<br>- CumulocityIoTEdge-Appliance-*version*-VMware.ovf<br><br> For Hyper-V, download the ZIP file:<br>- CumulocityIoTEdge-Appliance-*version*-HyperV.zip <br><br>The fixes for {{< product-c8y-iot >}} Edge:<br>- CumulocityIoTEdge-*version*.tar.gz |
|**{{< product-c8y-iot >}} Edge license file**|To request the license file for {{< product-c8y-iot >}} Edge, please contact the logistics team for your region:<br> - North and South America: LogisSrvus@softwareagusa.com <br>- All Other Regions: LogisticsServiceCenterGER@softwareag.com <br>In the email, you must include <br> - your company name, under which the license has been bought <br> - the domain name (for example, myedge.domain.com), where {{< product-c8y-iot >}} Edge will be reachable<br>For more information, see [Domain name validation for Edge license key generation](#domain-name-validation-for-edge-license-key-generation).|
|**SSL key and SSL certificate**|Optional. Use your internal or an external CA (Certification Authority) to generate these files. These files must not be password-protected. Ensure that the SSL certificate has the complete certificates chain in the right order.<br>**Info:** The .crt and .key files must be in the PEM format and the .key file must not be encrypted.|
|**DNS entry**|The DNS (Domain Name System) is used to resolve human readable host names like www.{{< domain-c8y >}} to machine readable IP addresses like 192.198.1.10. <br> If you want to connect to Edge appliance within your LAN, the DNS entry must be added for the domain name (URL under which {{< product-c8y-iot >}} Edge can be reached) with the IP address of the host.|
|**Edge cloud remote access**|To connect and manage one (or multiple) Edge appliances to your {{< product-c8y-iot >}} cloud tenant, you need an active {{< product-c8y-iot >}} {{< standard-tenant >}} with the Data Broker and Cloud Remote Access extensions.<br>**Info:** The Edge cloud remote access is an optional feature in {{< product-c8y-iot >}} Edge.|

### Domain name validation for Edge license key generation

To procure the {{< product-c8y-iot >}} Edge license file, you must provide the right domain name to the {{< company-sag >}}'s logistics team for Edge license key generation.

When you provide the domain name, consider the following points:

* The domain name does not need to be a Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN). For example, to access the Edge appliance with the domain name **myown.iot.com**, request the Edge license for **myown.iot.com** or **iot.com** (without the subdomain **myown**).

* If you exclude the subdomain from the domain name in the Edge license, you must possess a wildcard SSL certificate which can be used with multiple subdomains (**myown** or others) of the domain (**iot.com**).<br>
For example, if you provide **iot.com** as the domain name, you must possess an SSL certificate for **.iot.com**.

* If you have an Internationalized Domain Name (IDN), then you must provide the translated ASCII equivalent domain name.<br>
For example, if your domain name is **myown.iöt.com** (for example, containing **ö**), then you must use **myown.xn--it-fka.com**.<br>Also, provide the same translated ASCII equivalent domain name as the tenant domain name during the Edge installation process.<br>

	>**Info:** An Internationalized Domain Name (IDN) is an internet domain name that contains at least one label, in whole or in part, in a language-specific script or alphabet, such as Arabic, Chinese, Cyrillic, Devanagari, Hebrew or the Latin alphabet-based characters with diacritics or ligatures, such as French. The internationalization of domain names is a technical solution to translate names written in language-native scripts into an ASCII text representation that is compatible with the Domain Name System. See [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalized_domain_name).

* Ensure that you adhere to the following domain name validation rules:
	* The domain name must be a combination of case-insensitive alphanumeric characters separated by dot ( . ) or hyphen ( - ).
		* Cannot contain any letters of languages like Chinese, Latin or Arabic.
		* Cannot contain any special characters like (+ , ! @ # $ % ^ & * ( ) ; \ \ / | < > \ " \ ' ) other than dot ( . ) or hyphen ( - ).
	* The length of the domain name including the dot must not exceed 255 characters.
	* The domain name must contain at least one dot.
	* Each segment of the domain name must be separated by a dot.
		* The domain name must be between 1 to 63 characters long.
		* The Top-Level Domain (TLD) which refers to the last segment of the domain name must be between two to six characters long.
		* The domain name cannot begin or end with a hyphen.

### Network connectivity

The following network ports must be reachable from the local network:

* HTTPS
* MQTT over TLS
* SSH, only for configuring the appliance

If {{< product-c8y-iot >}} Edge should communicate with the cloud, the following ports of www.{{< domain-c8y >}} (or another instance) must be available:

* HTTPS
* MQTT over TLS

There is no internet connection required during installation. Internet connection during runtime is optional, and only used if this is configured in the Data Broker.

#### Incoming traffic

The following ports must be enabled by default in order to accept traffic from users and devices on the internet (also see [Setting up port forwarding](/edge/setting-up-edge/#vmware-port-forwarding):

|Source IP|Source Port|Destination IP|Destination Port|Service
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---
|any|any|Edge appliance IP|TTCP/443|HTTPS
|any|any|Edge appliance IP|TCP/1883|MQTT
|any|any|Edge appliance IP|TCP/8883|MQTT/TLS

Depending on additional integrations more ports must be opened.

#### Outgoing Traffic

The core node must be able to connect to the internet. Ports required to outside are:

|Service|Port|
|:---|:---|
|HTTPS|443|

Depending on the installed integrations (email, SMS, and so on), different ports might have to be opened in order to make these services available to the {{< product-c8y-iot >}} platform. The descriptions of these ports are delivered with the corresponding integrations.

Depending on the DNS and NTP setup it might be the case that DNS (UDP/53) and NTP (UDP/123) connections to the internet must be possible from all hosts.


### Hardware requirements

The virtual machine has the following minimum hardware requirements:

|Hardware|Configuration|
|:---|:---|
|Disk space|100 GB
|CPU|Intel x86
|Number of CPU cores|2 - without microservice <br>4 - with microservice
|RAM|6 GB - without microservice <br>8 GB - with microservice
|Network Interface Controller (NIC)|1

These are the minimum system requirements to enable the microservice hosting feature. If the microservice requires additional system resources, you must configure the system requirements accordingly in addition to minimum system requirements. For example, if the microservice requires 2 CPU cores and 4 GB of RAM, then the VM must have 6 CPU cores (4 cores for VM + 2 cores for microservice) and 12 GB of RAM (8 GB for VM + 4 GB for microservice).

>**Info:** This does not cover host operating system hardware requirements. The host operating system resource requirements must be sized independently and should be over and above the resource allocated to the virtual machines.
