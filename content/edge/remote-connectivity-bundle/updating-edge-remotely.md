You can remotely update your Edge appliance using the {{< product-c8y-iot >}}'s firmware update feature. This process requires you to upload the Edge archive file (tar.gz) to your tenant account or a server (you must provide the location of the archive on that server). For more information about the firmware feature, see [Device Management > Managing device data > Managing device firmware](/users-guide/device-management/#managing-device-firmware) in the *User guide*.

> **Important:** The Edge archive file size is about 3GB. If your tenant account has a limitation for uploading files with size over 1GB, contact Software AG support to increase the maximum file size for upload.

Before you update your Edge appliance remotely, you must:

- [Enable the remote-connectivity](/edge/remote-connectivity/#config-remote-connectivity) feature in your Edge appliance
- [Register your Edge appliance](/edge/remote-connectivity/#registering-the-edge-appliance-in-the-cumulocity-iot-tenant) in your {{< product-c8y-iot >}} tenant account

To remotely update your Edge appliance:

1. Log in to your {{< product-c8y-iot >}} tenant account.

2. Go to the Device Management application.

3. Click **Firmware repository** in the **Management** menu in the navigator.
