### To configure branding settings {#to-configure-branding-settings}

In the **Branding** page, you can maintain multiple branding variants. One of the branding variants is always configured as the global branding. The global branding will by default apply to all apps on your tenant and your subtenants.

<img src="/images/users-guide/enterprise-tenant/et-branding-variants-list.png" alt="Branding variants list">

In addition to the global branding, there can also be branding variants that apply only to specific applications. This allows to brand applications differently.

For each branding variant, you can configure various parameters like logos, colors and font types used throughout the platform.
The [parameters](#editing-parameters) can be configured through the multiple tabs available on the **Branding** page. Most of the parameters are immediately applied to your current window as a preview.

If you want to make changes to one of your branding variants, we recommend you to duplicate the corresponding branding variant first and to make your changes on the duplicated variant as any saved changes would immediately be applied. This way you can review and edit the preview of your branding variant first across all applications before it is set as global branding and/or applied to your target applications.

To edit a branding variant you can configure the following tabs:
- **Generic**: Allows you to change generic parameters of your branding that are the same across all themes.
- **Light theme**: Allows you to edit the branding parameters for the light theme.
- **Dark theme**: Allows you to edit the branding parameters for the dark theme. The dark theme support needs to be enabled first in the **Generic** tab.
- **Custom CSS**: Allows you to customize the looks of your applications even more by providing your own Cascading Style Sheets.
- **Advanced branding**: Allows you to make direct changes to the branding JSON object via a text editor. This can be useful to set some of the [ApplicationOptions the Web SDK provides](https://resources.cumulocity.com/documentation/websdk/ngx-components/classes/ApplicationOptions.html) which are not immediately supported by the branding editor.

For a more detailed preview of your settings, click **Open preview** to check the look and feel of your branding settings in the overall platform. You may interact and even switch applications in the preview. Every change that you make in the **Branding** page is immediately applied to the **Preview** page after you click **Save**.

Click **Save** at the bottom to save your final branding settings to your tenant. This applies them to the places your branding variant applies to.

To revert back to the default settings, click **Delete all variants** in the in the top menu bar. With this action all branding variants are deleted. We therefore recommend you to export your existing variants beforehand.

### Editing parameters {#editing-parameters}
