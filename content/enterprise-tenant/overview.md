An {{< enterprise-tenant >}} offers additional administrative functionality compared to a {{< standard-tenant >}}, the major difference being **multi-tenancy**.

Using an {{< enterprise-tenant >}}, you can:

* Create and manage subtenants.
* Manage the subscribed applications/features of the subtenants.
* Invoice subtenants based on usage statistics.

Moreover, an {{< enterprise-tenant >}} includes the following additional features:

* **Branding** - to configure an individual look & feel.
* **Domain name** - to provide an individual domain name.
* **User hierarchy** - to reflect entities with limited permissions to subsets of shared data.

For details on the {{< product-c8y-iot >}} tenant concept see [Tenant hierarchy](/getting-started/concepts/#tenant-hierarchy).
