### 3\. For what purposes do we process your personal data and on what legal basis?

Below we explain for what purposes and on what legal basis we process your personal data:

**Use of Online Services**

In order to provide our websites, cloud products or other web-based services ("Online Services") in a secure and stable manner, and (if applicable) for contractual use, as well as to be able to recognize and detect unlawful behavior, we process login, meta and contact data. On the one hand, this is in our legitimate interest and, on the other hand, may be necessary to fulfill a legal obligation or to fulfill a contractual relationship with you. Furthermore, we are interested in continuously improving our Online Services and user experience. For this purpose, we process information about your use of our Online Services or Metadata. In particular, we analyze popular or unused functions as well as settings for functions, which is in our legitimate interest. A personal analysis of your user behavior will only take place if you have previously consented to this. Our Online Services may include integrated content or links to content provided by third parties, such as videos. This Privacy Notice does not apply to third parties that provide such content.

**Performance of the business relationship**

In order to carry out the business relationship and manage our customers, business partners and interested parties, we process contact and business data about you as our contact person and any communication with you. This is in our legitimate interest or is necessary for the fulfillment of the existing contract with you. Furthermore, the processing of this data may be necessary for the fulfillment of a legal obligation.

**Marketing and communication**

To inform you about our products, services, events, technical and commercial news, forums, other networking opportunities and to respond to your requests to us, contact, marketing, business, login and metadata are processed.

In the context of participation in marketing campaigns, events and webinars, the use of marketing information may be analyzed for the continuous improvement of products and services. Such analyses may include, but are not limited to, opening or clicking links in emails and the duration of participation in webinars. Contact, meta and marketing data are processed for this purpose.

To communicate with us, for example by email or chat, and to respond to your inquiries, contact and business data are processed.

To enable the use of our forums and portals, contact, meta and login data are processed.

Processing your personal data for the aforementioned purposes is in general in our legitimate interest. If required by law, we will only process your personal data for these purposes if you have given your prior consent.

To be able to recognize and detect any illegal behavior when using our forums and portals, the processing of the aforementioned data may also be necessary to comply with a legal obligation.

**Application for a job**

Application data is required for applicant management to fill any vacancies. On the one hand, this is necessary for the implementation of pre-contractual measures to establish an employment relationship. On the other hand, we process this data to fulfill our legal obligations.

### 4\.  What are cookies and how are they processed?

### 5\. How do we share your data and how is it transferred to third countries?

We only share your personal data with recipients if this is necessary for fulfillment of the respective purpose. Your personal data may be transferred to and processed by:

* our subsidiaries to fulfill the purposes stated in this Privacy Notice;
* service providers, to provide IT and system administration, hosting, analytics, marketing, and customer purchase management services in accordance with the purposes stated above;

  The transfer of personal data to recipients located in a country outside the EEA for which the EU Commission has not issued an adequacy decision is based on the EU Standard Contractual Clauses.


### 6\. How long do we store your personal data?

We will delete or anonymize your personal data as soon as it is no longer required for the purposes stated in this Privacy Notice, or if you have requested us to do so and there is a right to data deletion. An exception may occur if legal retention obligations require a storage period that deviates from this.

If you have applied for a job or provided your data for future job postings, we will keep your personal data for one year after the last activity. This could be any activity, for example your recruiter had to send you a rejection because there was no match.  If there was no match, but your application was interesting to us, the recruiter will move your record to a candidate pool, which is exempt from purge. You will be notified by email, when this is the case. If you do not agree with the further storage of your data, you can simply send us a reply email and your data will be purged.
