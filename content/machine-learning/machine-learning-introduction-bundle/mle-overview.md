Machine Learning Engine enables machine learning/IT operators to manage and operationalize production-ready models for generating predictions on data gathered from connected devices. These capabilities can be leveraged either from a web browser via an easy to use graphical user interface or programmatically via REST API. Machine Learning Engine provides a high-performance inference platform with deployed models exposed as endpoints that can be leveraged from [Streaming Analytics](/apama/microservices/) and other applications for real-time inference.

Machine Learning Engine is composed of the following components:

| Name  | Application type | Description |
| ----- | -----            | -----       |
| [machine-learning](/machine-learning/web-app/) | WebApp | Graphical User Interface for Machine Learning Engine |
| [zementis](/machine-learning/api-reference/) | Microservice | Microservice backend for PMML model management and serving |
| [onnx](/machine-learning/api-reference/) | Microservice | Microservice backend for ONNX model management and serving |
| [nyoka](/machine-learning/api-reference/) | Microservice | Microservice backend for Time Series and Clustering models |
