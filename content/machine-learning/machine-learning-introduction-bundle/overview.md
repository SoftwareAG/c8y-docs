{{< product-c8y-iot >}} Machine Learning simplifies the complexity of the data science process across the entire machine learning lifecycle from model training to deployment. {{< product-c8y-iot >}} Machine Learning is composed of two applications: **Machine Learning Workbench**, which focuses on model training, and **Machine Learning Engine**, which focuses on model deployment.

The handover of the models from training environment to deployment environment is done via open-standards representation: [PMML](http://dmg.org/pmml/v4-4-1/GeneralStructure.html) and [ONNX](https://onnx.ai/). Open-standards based representation of machine learning models ensures interoperability between heterogeneous model development and deployment environments.
