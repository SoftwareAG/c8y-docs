{{< product-c8y-iot >}} provides you a utility tool for easy microservice packaging, deployment and subscription. The script requires a local installation of Docker and jq, which is a lightweight and flexible JSON processor.

### Prerequisites

#### Docker

Verify that you have a Docker installation. The Docker version must be >= 1.2.6

```shell
$ docker version
Client:
 Version:         1.12.6
 API version:     1.24
 OS/Arch:         linux/amd64

Server:
 Version:         1.12.6
 API version:     1.24
 OS/Arch:         linux/amd64
```

#### JSON processor

Execute the following command to install the JSON processor on Linux systems:

```shell
$ sudo yum install jq
```

For macOS, use the following command:

```shell
$ brew install jq
```

#### Bash

The microservice utility tool (script) needs Bash version 4+ to run. Verify your Bash version with the following command:

```shell
$ bash --version

GNU bash, version 5.0.3(1)-release (x86_64-apple-darwin18.2.0)
Copyright (C) 2019 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
```

macOS systems come with a preinstalled Bash version 3.x. Hence, you must update it in order to execute the microservice script. To do so, execute the following commands:

```shell
$ brew install bash
$ chsh -s /usr/local/bin/bash
```

If your Bash version has not changed while executing `bash --version`, you may need to restart your system. Note that the updated interpreter gets installed at */usr/local/bin/bash* and you must modify the first line of the microservice utility tool (script) as follows:

```bash
#!/usr/local/bin/bash

or

#!
```

### Configure the microservice utility tool

The script can be found in the GitHub repository: [cumulocity-examples](https://github.com/SoftwareAG/cumulocity-examples/blob/develop/microservices/scripts/microservice).

Change the mode to allow the script to be executed:

```shell
$ chmod +x microservice
```

Use the help option to see all the available functions (goals) and options:

```shell
$ ./microservice help
```

### Packing

A microservice must be packed as a Docker image in order to be deployed.
It requires a Docker _image.tar_ and _cumulocity.json_ files packed into a ZIP file.

The following directory structure is required to pack a microservice:

```bash
/docker/Dockerfile      # Instructions to build the Docker image
/docker/*               # All files within the directory will be included in the Docker build
/cumulocity.json        # The application manifest file
```

The script can be run in a parent folder holding such structure, or by passing the path to the directory using the `-dir` option. For instance, to pack a "Hello World" microservice application, execute:

```shell
$ ./microservice pack --name hello-world
```

It will create a ZIP file named _hello-world.zip_ and an intermediate _image.tar_ which is an exported Docker image.

{{< c8y-admon-important >}}
When naming your microservice application use only lower-case letters, digits and dashes. The maximum length for the name is 23 characters.
{{< /c8y-admon-important >}}

### Deploying

A microservice becomes available once it has been successfully deployed on the {{< product-c8y-iot >}} platform. This is done by uploading a ZIP file with the microservice packed as specified above. A user cannot directly push an image to the Docker registry.

Deploying your microservice application is rather easy, just execute the following command:

```shell
$ ./microservice deploy -n hello-world -d <URL> -u <username> -p <password> -te <tenant>
```

Note that you must have a tenant and user credentials in order to deploy your microservice.    
The successful execution will create an application on the {{< product-c8y-iot >}} platform with the specified name, if it does not exist yet. Then it will upload the _hello-world.zip_ file into the platform. Once it has been uploaded, your application will be listed in **Ecosystem** > **Microservices** in the Administration application.

For further information on deploying microservices to {{< product-c8y-iot >}}, refer to [Administration > Managing and monitoring microservices](/users-guide/administration#managing-microservices) in the *User guide*.

### Subscribing

You must subscribe to the application in order to use it. Execute the following command to subscribe your tenant to the deployed microservice:

```shell
$ ./microservice subscribe -n hello-world -d <URL> -u <username> -p <password> -te <tenant> -id <APPLICATION_ID>
```

It will result in tenant subscription to an application specified by the ID parameter. If the user has already been subscribed, a warning message will be displayed.

### Multiple goals

Goals can be executed together to pack, deploy and subscribe the application in a single line. In this case, the application ID will be automatically pulled by the script.

```shell
$ ./microservice pack deploy subscribe -n hello-world -d <URL> -u <username> -p <password> -te <tenant>
```

### Operating microservices

{{< product-c8y-iot >}} manages microservices by monitoring the microservice instance and storing the metrics. In case a microservice exceeds the memory limit, it is restarted automatically. Also, microservices can be auto-scaled in case of high CPU usage. For more information, review the [scaling](#isolation-levels) details above.
