This section contains step-by-step tutorials to successfully develop microservices which employ the {{< product-c8y-iot >}} APIs and other third-party services. The source code of the examples can be found in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/SoftwareAG/cumulocity-examples/tree/develop/microservices).

On the {{< product-c8y-iot >}} platform, microservice hosting is built on top of Docker containers. This makes it technology-agnostic and allows developers to create applications in any technology stack.
