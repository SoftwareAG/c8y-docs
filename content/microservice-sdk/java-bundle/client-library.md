This section provides an overview on how to access {{< product-c8y-iot >}} from Java clients, starting from connecting to the platform over accessing data to remote control of devices. It also discusses how to extend the {{< product-c8y-iot >}} domain model from Java for new devices and other business objects. Finally, this section describes how to configure the logging service in order to control the level of diagnostic messages generated by the client.

The client library is tightly linked to the design of the REST interfaces, which are described in [REST implementation](https://{{< domain-c8y >}}/api/{{< c8y-current-version >}}/#section/REST-implementation) in the {{< openapi >}}.


### Connecting to the platform

The root interface for connecting to {{< product-c8y-iot >}} from Java is called Platform (see Root interface in [REST implementation](https://{{< domain-c8y >}}/api/{{< c8y-current-version >}}/#section/REST-implementation) in the {{< openapi >}}). It provides access to all other interfaces of the platform, such as the inventory. In its simplest form, it is instantiated as follows:

```java
Platform platform = new PlatformImpl("<URL>", new CumulocityCredentials("<USERNAME>", "<PASSWORD>"));
```

As an example:

```java
Platform platform = new PlatformImpl("https://demos.cumulocity.com", new CumulocityCredentials("myuser", "mypassword"));
```

If you use the Java client for developing an application, you must register an application key (through [Ecosysystem > Applications](/users-guide/administration#managing-applications) in the {{< product-c8y-iot >}} Administration application, or through the [Application API](https://{{< domain-c8y >}}/api/{{< c8y-current-version >}}/#tag/Application-API)).

For testing purposes, every tenant is subscribed to the demo application key "uL27no8nhvLlYmW1JIK1CA==". The constructor for `PlatformImpl` also allows you to specify the default number of objects returned from the server in one reply with the parameter `pageSize`.

```java
new CumulocityCredentials("<TENANT_ID>", "<USERNAME>", "<PASSWORD>", "<APPLICATION_KEY>")
```

### Accessing the inventory

The following code snippet shows how to obtain a handle to the inventory:

```java
InventoryApi inventory = platform.getInventoryApi();
```

Using this handle, you can create, retrieve and update managed objects. For example, if you would like to retrieve all objects that have a geographical position, use the following:

```java
InventoryFilter inventoryFilter = new InventoryFilter();
inventoryFilter.byFragmentType(Position.class);
ManagedObjectCollection moc = inventory.getManagedObjectsByFilter(inventoryFilter);
```

Note that it returns a query to get the objects but it does not actually get them. In practice, such a list of objects could be very large. Hence, it is returned in pages from the server. To get all pages and iterate over them, use the following:

```java
for (ManagedObjectRepresentation mo : moc.get().allPages()) {
	System.out.println(mo.getName());
}
```

{{< c8y-admon-important >}}
By default, `allPages()` doesn't return all elements at once, rather in batches of 5 elements (paginated). A separate request is made for each subsequent page after the iteration of the previous page is completed. Hence, it is not recommended to change/edit those objects while iterating through them, otherwise the filters may include/exclude different elements. It is better to collect them all and save them in memory, and only then perform edit operations.
{{< /c8y-admon-important >}}

To create a new managed object, construct a local representation of the object and send it to the platform. The following code snippet shows how to create a new electricity meter with a relay in it:

```java
ManagedObjectRepresentation mo = new ManagedObjectRepresentation();
mo.setName("MyMeter-1");

Relay relay = new Relay();
mo.set(relay);

SinglePhaseElectricitySensor meter = new SinglePhaseElectricitySensor();
mo.set(meter);

// Set additional properties, for example, tariff tables
mo = inventory.create(mo);
System.out.println(mo.getId());
```

By invoking the `create()` method, a new managed object is created with an auto-generated unique identifier.

Assume that you would like to store additional custom properties along with the device. This can be done by creating a new fragment in the form of a Java bean. For example, assume that you would like to store tariff information along with your meter. There is a day and a night time tariff, and you must store the hours during which the night time tariff is active:

```java
public class Tariff {
    public int getNightTariffStart() {
        return nightTariffStart;
    }

    public void setNightTariffStart(int nightTariffStart) {
        this.nightTariffStart = nightTariffStart;
    }

    public int getNightTariffEnd() {
        return nightTariffEnd;
    }

    public void setNightTariffEnd(int nightTariffEnd) {
        this.nightTariffEnd = nightTariffEnd;
    }

    private int nightTariffStart = 22;
    private int nightTariffEnd = 6;
}
```

Now, you can add the tariff information to your meter:

```java
Tariff tariff = new Tariff();
mo.set(tariff);
```

### Accessing the identity service

A device typically has a technical identifier that an agent needs to know to be able to contact the device. Examples are meter numbers, IP addresses and REST URLs. To associate such identifiers with the unique identifier of {{< product-c8y-iot >}}, agents can use the identity service. Again, to create the association, create an object of type `ExternalIDRepresentation` and send it to the platform.

The code snippet below shows how to register a REST URL for a device. It assumes that `mo` is the managed object from the above example and `deviceUrl` is a string with the REST URL of the device.

```java
final String ASSET_TYPE = "com_cumulocity_idtype_AssetTag";
final String deviceUrl = "SAMPLE-A-239239232";

ExternalIDRepresentation externalIDGid = new ExternalIDRepresentation();
externalIDGid.setType(ASSET_TYPE);
externalIDGid.setExternalId(deviceUrl);
externalIDGid.setManagedObject(mo);

IdentityApi identityApi= platform.getIdentityApi();
identityApi.create(externalIDGid);
```

Now, if you need the association back, you can just query the identity service as follows:

```java
ID id = new ID();
id.setType(ASSET_TYPE);
id.setValue(deviceUrl);
externalIDGid = identityApi.getExternalId(id);
```

The returned object will contain the unique identifier and a link to the managed object.


### Accessing events and measurements

Events and measurements can be accessed in a very similar manner as described above for the inventory. The following example queries the signal strength of the mobile connection of devices in the past two weeks and prints the device ID, the time of the measurement, the received signal strength and the bit error rate.

```java
MeasurementApi measurementApi = platform.getMeasurementApi();
MeasurementFilter measurementFilter = new MeasurementFilter();

Calendar cal = Calendar.getInstance();
Date toDate = cal.getTime();
cal.add(Calendar.DATE, -14);

Date fromDate = cal.getTime();
measurementFilter.byDate(fromDate, toDate);
measurementFilter.byFragmentType(SignalStrength.class);

MeasurementCollection mc = measurementApi.getMeasurementsByFilter(measurementFilter);
MeasurementCollectionRepresentation measurements = mc.get();

for (; measurements != null; measurements = mc.getNextPage(measurements)) {
	for (MeasurementRepresentation measurement : measurements.getMeasurements()) {
		SignalStrength signal = measurement.get(SignalStrength.class);
		System.out.println(measurement.getSource().getId() + " " + measurement.getTime() + " " + signal.getRssiValue() + " " + signal.getBerValue());
	}
}
```

### Controlling devices

The `DeviceControlResource` enables you to manipulate devices remotely. It has two sides: You can create operations in applications to be sent to devices, and you can query operations from agents.

In order to control a device it must be in the child devices hierarchy of an agent managed object. The agent managed object represents your agent in the inventory. It is identified by a fragment com\_cumulocity\_model\_Agent. This is how {{< product-c8y-iot >}} identifies where to send operations to control a particular device.

The following code demonstrates the setup:

```java
ManagedObjectRepresentation agent = new ManagedObjectRepresentation();
agent.set(new com.cumulocity.model.Agent()); // agents must include this fragment

// ... create agent in inventory
ManagedObjectRepresentation device;

// ... create device in inventory
ManagedObjectReferenceRepresentation child2Ref = new ManagedObjectReferenceRepresentation();
child2Ref.setManagedObject(device);
inventory.getManagedObject(agent.getId()). addChildDevice(child2Ref);
```

For example, assume that you would like to switch off a relay in a meter from an application. Similar to the previous examples, you create the operation to be executed locally, and then send it to the platform:

```java
DeviceControlApi control = platform.getDeviceControlApi();
OperationRepresentation operation = new OperationRepresentation();

operation.setDeviceId(mo.getId());
relay.setRelayState(RelayState.OPEN);
operation.set(relay);
control.create(operation);
```

Now, if you would like to query the pending operations from an agent, the following code would need to be executed:

```java
OperationFilter operationFilter = new OperationFilter();
operationFilter.byAgent(mo.getId().getValue());
operationFilter.byStatus(OperationStatus.PENDING);
OperationCollection oc = control.getOperationsByFilter(operationFilter);
```

Again, the returned result may come in several pages due to its potential size.

```java
OperationCollectionRepresentation opCollectionRepresentation;

for (opCollectionRepresentation = oc.get(); opCollectionRepresentation != null; opCollectionRepresentation = oc.getNextPage(opCollectionRepresentation)) {
	for (OperationRepresentation op : opCollectionRepresentation.getOperations()) {
		System.out.println(op.getStatus());
	}
}
```

### Realtime features

The Java client libraries fully support the real-time APIs of {{< product-c8y-iot >}}. For example, to get immediately notified when someone sends an operation to your agent, use the following code:

```java
Subscriber<GId, OperationRepresentation> subscriber = deviceControl.getNotificationsSubscriber();
Subscription<> subscription = subscriber.subscribe(agentId, new SubscriptionListener<GId, OperationRepresentation> {

    public void onError(Subscription<GId> sub, Throwable e) {
		logger.error("OperationDispatcher error!", e);
	}

	public void onNotification(Subscription<GId> sub, OperationRepresentation operation) {
		// Execute the operation
	}
});
```

{{< c8y-admon-info >}}
"agentId" is the ID of your agent in the inventory.
{{< /c8y-admon-info >}}

To unsubscribe from a subscription, use the following code:

```java
subscription.unsubscribe();
```

If you wish to disconnect, the following code must be used:

```java
subscriber.disconnect();
```

### Subscribing to Notifications 2.0

The Notifications 2.0 API can be accessed in a very similar manner as described above in [Accessing the inventory](#accessing-the-inventory).
See [Notifications 2.0](/reference/notifications) in the *Reference guide* for more details about the API.

The following snippet shows how users can create, query and delete notification subscriptions. It also shows how a token string can be obtained.

```java
// Obtain a handle to the Subscription and Token APIs:
private final NotificationSubscriptionApi notificationSubscriptionApi = platform.getNotificationSubscriptionApi();
private final TokenApi tokenApi = platform.getTokenApi();

// Create subscription filter
final NotificationSubscriptionFilterRepresentation filterRepresentation = new NotificationSubscriptionFilterRepresentation();
filterRepresentation.setApis(List.of("measurements"));
filterRepresentation.setTypeFilter("c8y_Speed");

// Construct subscription for managed object context
final NotificationSubscriptionRepresentation subscriptionRepresentation1 = new NotificationSubscriptionRepresentation();
subscriptionRepresentation1.setContext("mo");
subscriptionRepresentation1.setSubscription("testSubscription1");
subscriptionRepresentation1.setSource(mo);
subscriptionRepresentation1.setSubscriptionFilter(filterRepresentation);
subscriptionRepresentation1.setFragmentsToCopy(List.of("c8y_SpeedMeasurement", "c8y_MaxSpeedMeasurement"));

// Create subscription for managed object context
subscriptionApi.subscribe(subscriptionRepresentation1);

// Construct subscription for tenant context
final NotificationSubscriptionRepresentation subscriptionRepresentation2 = new NotificationSubscriptionRepresentation();
subscriptionRepresentation2.setContext("tenant");
subscriptionRepresentation2.setSubscription("testSubscription2");

// Create subscription for tenant context
subscriptionApi.subscribe(subscriptionRepresentation2);

// Obtain access token
final NotificationTokenRequestRepresentation tokenRequestRepresentation = new NotificationTokenRequestRepresentation(
        properties.getSubscriber(), // The subscriber name with which the client wishes to be identified.
        "testSubscription1",        // The subscription name. This value should be the same as with which the subscription was created. The access token will be only valid for the subscription specified here.
        1440,                       // The token expiration duration in minutes.
        false);

// The obtained token is required for establishing a WebSocket connection. Refer to [Notifications 2.0](/reference/notifications) in the *Reference guide* for more details.
final String token = tokenApi.create(tokenRequestRepresentation).getTokenString();

// Query all subscriptions
final NotificationSubscriptionCollection notificationSubscriptionCollection = subscriptionApi.getSubscriptions();
final List<NotificationSubscriptionRepresentation> subscriptions = notificationSubscriptionCollection.get().getSubscriptions();

for (NotificationSubscriptionRepresentation subscriptionRepresentation : subscriptions) {
    System.out.println(subscriptionRepresentation);
}

// Query subscriptions by filter
final NotificationSubscriptionCollection filteredNotificationSubscriptionCollection = subscriptionApi
        .getSubscriptionsByFilter(new NotificationSubscriptionFilter().byContext("mo"));
final List<NotificationSubscriptionRepresentation> filteredSubscriptions = filteredNotificationSubscriptionCollection.get().getSubscriptions();

for (NotificationSubscriptionRepresentation subscriptionRepresentation : filteredSubscriptions) {
    System.out.println(subscriptionRepresentation);
}

// Delete all tenant subscriptions
subscriptionApi.deleteTenantSubscriptions();

// Delete by source
subscriptionApi.deleteBySource(mo.getId().getValue());
```

There is a sample microservice available in the [cumulocity-examples repository](https://github.com/SoftwareAG/cumulocity-examples/tree/develop/hello-world-notification-microservice) with more details on the API usage.

### Reliability features

In particular on mobile devices, Internet connectivity might be unreliable. To support such environments, the Java client libraries support local buffering. This means that you can pass data to the client libraries regardless of an Internet connection being available or not. If a connection is available, the data will be sent immediately. If not, the data will be buffered until the connection is back again. For this, asynchronous variants of the API calls are offered. For example, to send an alarm:

```java
AlarmApi alarmApi = platform.getAlarmApi();
Future future = alarmApi.createAsync(anAlarm);
```

The `createAsync` method returns immediately. The `Future` object can be used to determine the result of the request whenever it was actually carried out.

### Logging configuration

Logging in the Java client SDK is handled through [slf4j](http://www.slf4j.org/) with a [logback](http://logback.qos.ch) backend. For a detailed description on how to use and configure logging, see the [logback documentation](http://logback.qos.ch/documentation.html).

Since version 0.11, the default logging level of the SDK is set to "Error" for all components, which means that logging messages are suppressed unless their level is "Error". If everything runs smoothly, there should be no log messages generated by the SDK. By default, log messages are sent to the console only.

The default logging configuration can be changed by providing a new configuration file. Two methods for providing the configuration file are discussed here: via an absolute filename passed using a system property; and via an OSGi fragment. Note that both of these methods override the default behaviour, rather than extending it.
