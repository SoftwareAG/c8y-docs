title: Services platform and SMS API
---

This section describes the {{< product-c8y-iot >}} SMS API and shows how to access it using the {{< product-c8y-iot >}} Java Client. You will also learn how to send and receive SMS messages via the Java Client API.

### Using the services platform

The services platform interface is responsible for connecting to the Java services (SMS) API.

```java
ServicesPlatform platform = new ServicesPlatformImpl("<URL>", new CumulocityCredentials("<tenant>", "<user>", "<password>", "<application key>"));
```

The URL pointing to the platform must be of the form *&lt;tenant>.{{< domain-c8y >}}*, for example *https://demos.{{< domain-c8y >}}*, which will process all the API requests.

{{< c8y-admon-info >}}
You must have appropriate credentials to be able to access the Services API from outside. See the example above.
{{< /c8y-admon-info >}}

### Accessing the SMS Messaging API

The following code snippet shows how to obtain a handle to the SMS API from Java.

```java
SmsMessagingApi smsMessagingApi = platform.getSmsMessagingApi();
```

Using this handle, you can send and retrieve the SMS messages from Java by calling its functions.

### Assigning required roles

To use the SMS messaging API, the user must have the required roles SMS_ADMIN and SMS_READ for sending and receiving messages respectively.
Refer to [Administration > Managing permissions](/users-guide/administration#managing-permissions) in the *User guide*.

### Sending a message

To send a SMS message using the API, prepare the message with the SendMessageRequest builder and call the sendMessage function of the API with the prepared message.

```java
SendMessageRequest smsMessage = SendMessageRequest.builder()
        .withSender(Address.phoneNumber("<phone number>"))
        .withReceiver(Address.phoneNumber("<phone number>"))
        .withMessage("<message text>")
        .build();

smsMessagingApi.sendMessage(smsMessage);
```

### Receiving messages

You can use the API as follows to receive all SMS messages. Note that not every SMS provider supports receiving messages.

```java
smsMessagingApi.getAllMessages(Address.phoneNumber("<phone number>"));
```

You can use the API as follows to receive a specific SMS message identified by message ID. Note that not every SMS provider supports receiving messages.

```java
smsMessagingApi.getMessage(Address.phoneNumber("<phone number>"), "<message id>");
```

### SMS management endpoints

The Rest API can be used to send and receive SMS messages.

Sending a message:

```http
POST /service/messaging/smsmessaging/outbound/tel:<sender phone number>/requests
Host: ...
Authorization: Basic ...
Content-Type: application/json
{
    "outboundSMSMessageRequest": {
        "address": ["tel:<phone number>"],
        "senderAddress": "tel:<phone number>",
        "outboundSMSTextMessage": {
  	       "message": "<message text>"
        },
        "receiptRequest": {
  	       "notifyUrl": "<notify url>",
  	        "callbackData": "<callback data>"
        },
        "senderName": "<sender name>"
    }
}
```

Receiving all messages:

```http
GET /service/messaging/smsmessaging/inbound/registrations/tel:<receiver phone number>/messages
Host: ...
Authorization: Basic ...

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
{
     "inboundSMSMessageList": [
        {
            "inboundSMSMessage": {
            "dateTime": "<date>",
            "destinationAddress": "<destination address>",
            "messageId": "<message id>",
            "message": "<message>",
            "resourceURL": "<resource url>",
            "senderAddress": "<sender address>"
        }
     ]
}
```

Receiving a specific message:

```http
GET /service/messaging/smsmessaging/inbound/registrations/tel:<receiver phone number>/messages/<message id>
Host: ...
Authorization: Basic ...

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
{
    "inboundSMSMessage": {
        "dateTime": "<date>",
        "destinationAddress": "<destination address>",
        "messageId": "<message id>",
        "message": "<message>",
