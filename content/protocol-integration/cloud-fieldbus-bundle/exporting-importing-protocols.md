To manage device protocols more conveniently, you can export them to a file. The file can be re-imported to  set up other {{< product-c8y-iot >}} accounts easily or to restore the protocols from a backup. The import functionality also supports importing ready-made device protocols provided by device manufacturers.

To export a device protocol, click the menu icon <i class="dlt-c8y-icon-menu-vertical text-muted icon-20"></i> at the right of the respective row and click **Export**.

A file with the device protocol definition will be downloaded, named "&lt;device type&gt;.json".

2. In the resulting dialog box, either select a pre-defined protocol or upload a file with a previously exported device protocol.
3. You may enter a new name for the device protocol.
