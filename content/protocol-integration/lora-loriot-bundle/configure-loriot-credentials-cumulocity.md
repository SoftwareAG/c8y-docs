### Creation of Loriot LNS Connection in Cumulocity IoT

Before using LoRa devices with {{< product-c8y-iot >}}, you must configure the {{< product-c8y-iot >}} Loriot agent endpoint details in the Administration application. Click the **Connectivity** tab in the **Settings** menu to create, edit, delete or update multiple Loriot connections.

#### To add a new connection

When you select **Connectivity** for the first time, you are asked to create a connection. Click **Add Connection**.

Enter the following information:

- **Name** - the name of the Loriot connection being created
- **Base URL** - the URL associated with the Loriot provider account
- **Username** - your Loriot account username
- **Password** - your Loriot account password

Click **Save**. If the information you have entered is correct, the message "Connection created" appears.

To add another connection, click **Add Connection** and follow the steps above.

Always keep the **Gateway Information** option enabled because the Loriot agent only processes "gw" (gateway information) messages.

### Loriot device registration

To register a Loriot device in {{< product-c8y-iot >}} navigate to **Devices** > **Registration** in the Device management application, click **Register device** at the top right and select **Single device registration** > **LORIOT LoRa** from the dropdown.

![Register devices](/images/device-protocols/lora-loriot/loriot-selection.png)

{{< c8y-admon-info >}}
If Loriot is not one of the available options, your tenant is not subscribed to the relevant applications, see information at the top.
{{< /c8y-admon-info >}}

In the next window, fill in the required information:

- **Title** - title of the device to be registered.
- **Device EUI** - this is the unique identifier for the device. It is a 16 character (8 byte) long hexadecimal number. You can find it on the device itself.
- **Application EUI** - this is a global application ID in the IEEE EUI64 address space that uniquely identifies the application provider of the device. It is a 16 character (8 byte) long hexadecimal number.
- **Application key** - this is an AES-128 application key specific for the device that is assigned to the device by the application owner and is responsible to encrypt. The application key is a 32 character (16 byte) long hexadecimal number.
- **Connection** - lists all configured Loriot connections in the tenant. The **Application name** option (see below) is populated based on the selected Loriot connection.
- **Application name** - select the appropriate application name under which the device must be registered in the Loriot provider.
- **Device protocol** - select the appropriate device protocol from the dropdown list. For more information on how to create a device protocol refer to [Creating device protocols](#create-loriot-device-protocols).

![Register devices](/images/device-protocols/lora-loriot/loriot-registration.png)

Click **Register** to submit the device registration request and create the device.

You can verify that the device is connected by incoming events. Click on a device and open its **Events** tab. All events related to this device are listed.

For more information on viewing and managing your connected devices, also refer to [Device management](/users-guide/device-management/) in the *User guide*.

In order to migrate the device from one LNS connection to another, the device must be re-registered:

1. Navigate to the **LPWAN** tab of the Device.
2. Click the **Provider connection** dropdown.
3. A prompt will appear stating that in order to migrate the device from one LNS connection to another, you must re-register the device. Click the **Re-Register** button.
4. You are directed to the device registration page where you can perform the re-registration following the steps above and selecting the desired LNS connection.
