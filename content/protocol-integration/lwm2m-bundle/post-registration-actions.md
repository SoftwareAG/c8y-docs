The LWM2M shell commands can be performed in the **Shell** tab of each device. It is also possible to execute some common operations when a device sends a full registration request.
This can be done in the **LWM2M post-operations** page accessible from the **Device types** menu in the navigator. A set of shell commands can be saved in the Commands section, which will be performed on each device on registration.

The above image shows the **LWM2M post-operations** page with a set of sample shell commands.
More information on shell commands can be found in [LightweightM2M > Handling LWM2M shell commands](/protocol-integration/lwm2m/#shell-commands) in the <em>Protocols integration guide</em>.

### Device operations handling

If the operations are created while the device is offline, all the operations will be executed when the device comes online as those operations will be delivered through the real-time channel.
A configurable property can limit the number of operations to be executed as part of the post-registration process, for example, the operations which were already delivered to the device once via the real-time channel, but they still have a status of PENDING.

The default maximum limit of the pending operations is 10, which is a configurable value for the agent. In case this limit is not sufficient for your use case please contact [product support](/welcome/contacting-support/).
