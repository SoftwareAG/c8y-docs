OPC Unified Architecture (OPC UA) is a standard pushed by the OPC Foundation for industry automation. The goal of OPC UA is to enable the communication between industrial devices. OPC UA is designed to work across technology boundaries (cross-platform). There are two components designed to accomplish this integration:

- OPC UA device gateway
- OPC UA management service

![Integration overview](/images/device-protocols/opcua/opcua-integration-overview.png)

The OPC UA device gateway is a stand-alone Java program that communicates with OPC UA server(s) and the {{< product-c8y-iot >}} platform. It stores data into the {{< product-c8y-iot >}} database via REST. Additionally, C8Y commands are executed to perform various operations on the OPC UA servers.

The gateway must be registered as {{< product-c8y-iot >}} device in a specific tenant and the opcua-device-gateway must run in the users' environment.

In order to use OPC UA, you must be subscribed to the "opcua-mgmt-service" microservice. If the "opcua-mgmt-service" microservice is not available in your tenant, please contact [product support](/welcome/contacting-support/).

To download the gateway navigate to [{{< product-c8y-iot >}} resources](http://resources.{{< domain-c8y >}}/examples/opc-ua/).

The gateway requires Java 11 in order to run.
