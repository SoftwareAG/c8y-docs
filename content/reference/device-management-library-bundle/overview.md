The device management library defines the data structures that are used in {{< product-c8y-iot >}} for device management activities like, for example, software management and configuration management. The data structures are expressed as fragments that can be used inside managed objects, operations and other resources. More information on the fragment concept can be found in the [{{< product-c8y-iot >}} domain model](/concepts/domain-model/) in the *Concepts guide*.

In the following section you will find descriptions of the most important functionalities of a device, its managed objects and all its corresponding fragments to them. We will explain the relationship between the {{< product-c8y-iot >}} UI, the device object managed in our databases and what is being communicated to and from the device itself.

If you are interested in details on exposing the {{< product-c8y-iot >}}´s functionalities through our Rest API, see the [{{< openapi >}}](https://{{< domain-c8y >}}/api/) for further information.

Moreover, see [SmartREST](/reference/smartrest-two) for more information on SmartREST and a complete list of all SmartREST templates mentioned throughout the following sections.

To start with device management, open the **All devices** tab in the **Devices** menu of the Device Management application. Click on a device in the list to open the device details of this particular device. You will see various tabs and particular information on each of them.

{{< c8y-admon-info >}}
For a detailed explanation of each tab and its related configuration via the UI, see also [Device Management > Device details](/users-guide/device-management/#device-details) in the *User guide*.
{{< /c8y-admon-info >}}

This list can be manipulated through the device fragments, that means, which tabs are shown depends on the capability the device supports. This is mainly operated by one fragment called ```c8y_SupportedOperations```. Based on what is put in the array of this fragment, functionality such as tabs, buttons, and so on are enabled. For example if the ```c8y_SupportedOperations``` fragment contains ```c8y_Firmware```, the firmware tab will be visible in the **Device details** page and the device can manage firmware objects.

#### c8y_SupportedOperations fragments

The following fragments can be added to the ```c8y_SupportedOperations``` fragment:
