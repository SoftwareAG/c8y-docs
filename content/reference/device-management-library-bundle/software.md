The **Software** tab allows you to install and uninstall a set of software files for a device. The files can be located
using an URL or they can be hosted in the {{< product-c8y-iot >}} Software Repository. Device agents are fully
responsible for their local installation, management, and uninstall procedures and any kind of error handling during the
operation.

The **Device details** page shows a **Software** tab for devices that announce `c8y_SoftwareList`
and/or `c8y_SoftwareUpdate` in their `c8y_SupportedOperations` fragment in their device managed objects. It also shows
a **Services** tab for devices that have at least one software service running. The service can have measurements,
alarms and events assigned.

### Installed software

There are two ways in which a device managed object may represent its installed software packages. It may list them
in `c8y_SoftwareList` fragment or as the child additions. The latter approach also requires the device to
have `c8y_SupportedSoftwareTypes` fragment. Let's call the first approach *legacy* and the second *advanced*.

A software package, represented as the list entry or as a child addition, must contain following properties:

| Field | Mandatory | Details |
|----|----|----|
| name | Yes | The name of the software|
| version | Yes | A version identifier of the software|
| url | No | A URL pointing to the location where the software file was obtained from|
| softwareType | No | An arbitrary string for organizing software artifacts|

The name and the version are used to identify the package. Already mentioned `c8y_SupportedSoftwareTypes` fragment
restricts possible software types that can be installed on the device.

#### Legacy Software Management

A device may update its software list by updating its managed object `c8y_SoftwareList` fragment.

```http
PUT /inventory/managedObjects/<deviceId>
```

```json
{
  "c8y_SoftwareList": [
    {
      "name": "software_a",
      "version": "3.0.0",
      "url": "http://example.com/software_a",
      "softwareType": "type A"
    },
    {
      "name": "software_b",
      "version": "2.0.0",
      "url": "http://example.com/software_b",
      "softwareType": "type B"
    }
  ]
}
```

Devices should upload the complete list of installed software during startup. Additionally the list should be updated
any time a local change is triggered or detected. This includes cases where a change was requested through {{<
product-c8y-iot >}} UI.

**SmartREST example**

{{< product-c8y-iot >}} provides the static SmartREST template 116 for devices to upload their installed software. It
takes a dynamic length list of triples per software package as parameters. Each triple is interpreted as the name,
version, and URL property of an individual package:

`116,software_a,3.0.0,http://example.com/software_a,software_b,2.0.0,http://example.com/software_b`

#### Changing installed software

Within the **Software** tab users can select software to install, to update, and to uninstall for a device. After
confirming, the desired software configuration is sent to the device as an operation. The operation format depends on
the device's ```c8y_SupportedOperations``` fragment.

##### Software list

If the device only supports the ```c8y_SoftwareList``` operation and the ```c8y_SupportedOperations``` fragment does not
contain ```c8y_SoftwareUpdate```, a ```c8y_SoftwareList``` operation is sent to the device. This operation contains a
very similar ```c8y_SoftwareList``` fragment to the one that is already present in the device’s own managed object.
The ```c8y_SoftwareList``` operation always contains the entire list of software that should be installed on the device.
Exactly the packages in the list should be installed. Any installed packages not contained in the list should be
removed.

```json
{
  "c8y_SoftwareList": [
    {
      "name": "software_a",
      "version": "4.0.0",
      "url": "http://example.com/software_a"
    },
    {
      "name": "software_b",
      "version": "3.0.0",
      "url": "http://example.com/software_b"
    }
  ]
}
```

| Field | DataType | Mandatory | Details |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| name | string | Yes | Name of the software|
| version | string | Yes | A version identifier of the software|
| url | string | Yes | A URL pointing to the location where the software file should be downloaded from|

The device is expected to perform the following actions:

1. Set operation status to EXECUTING
2. Uninstall software that should be uninstalled
3. Install software that should be installed
4. Update the software list in the device’s own managed object
5. Set operation status to SUCCESSFUL

If the desired state cannot be achieved for any reason the operation should be concluded with status FAILED.

**SmartREST example**

The 516 static response template is available for dealing with software list operations. It works very similarly to the
116 template used for updating the device’s own managed object:

1. Receive ```c8y_SoftwareList``` operation <br>
   `516,deviceSerial,software_a,4.0.0,http://example.com/software_a,software_b,3.0.0,http://example.com/software_b`
2. Set operation status to EXECUTING <br>
   `501,c8y_SoftwareList`
3. Uninstall and install software
4. Update device’s software list in inventory <br>
   `116,software_a,4.0.0,http://example.com/software_a,software_b,3.0.0,http://example.com/software_b`
5. Set operation status to SUCCESSFUL <br>
   `503,c8y_SoftwareList`

##### Software update

If a device supports the ```c8y_SoftwareUpdate``` operation in its ```c8y_SupportedOperations``` fragment the **
Software** tab will create ```c8y_SoftwareUpdate``` operations for the device. Conceptually the software update is very
similar to the software list. A desired state of software is sent to the device in form of a list of packages. The
difference is that the ```c8y_SoftwareUpdate``` should be considered as a partial list. Each list element contains an
additional instruction whether the package should be installed or uninstalled. Any package not listed in the software
update list should not be touched.

```json
{
  "c8y_SoftwareUpdate": [
    {
      "name": "software_a",
      "version": "4.0.0",
      "url": "http://example.com/software_a",
      "action": "install"
    },
    {
      "name": "software_b",
      "version": "3.0.0",
      "url": "http://example.com/software_b",
      "action": "delete"
    }
  ]
}
```

| Field | DataType | Mandatory | Details |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
|name |string |Yes |Name of the software|
|version |string | Yes | A version identifier of the software|
|url |string |Yes |A URL pointing to the location where the software file should be downloaded from|
|action |string |Yes |Action to be executed from the device on the software (possible values: "install" or "delete")|

The device is expected to perform the following actions:

1. Set operation status to EXECUTING
2. Iterate through the list of packages contained in the operation and perform the respective action for each one
3. Update the software list in the device’s own managed object
4. Set operation status to SUCCESSFUL

**SmartREST example**

The 528 static response template is available for dealing with software update operations:

1. Receive ```c8y_SoftwareUpdate``` operation <br>
   `528,deviceSerial,software_a,4.0.0,http://example.com/software_a,install,software_b,3.0.0,http://example.com/software_b,delete`
2. Set operation status to EXECUTING <br>
   `501,c8y_SoftwareUpdate`
3. Uninstall and install software
4. Update device’s software list in inventory <br>
   `116,software_a,3.0.0,http://example.com/software_a`
5. Set operation status to SUCCESSFUL <br>
   `503,c8y_SoftwareUpdate`

### Advanced Software Management

In this approach software packages became separate entities and are represented as the device managed object child
additions. To facilitate the management of them, the Advanced Software Management
default [microservice](https://cumulocity.com/guides/concepts/applications/#microservices)
was introduced.

Devices may indicate their support for Advanced Software Management by including the ```c8y_SoftwareUpdate``` operation
in their ```c8y_SupportedOperations``` fragment and additionally listing their supported software types in
the ```c8y_SupportedSoftwareTypes``` fragment.

```json
{
  "c8y_SupportedOperations": [
    "c8y_SoftwareUpdate"
  ],
  "c8y_SupportedSoftwareTypes": [
    "type_a",
    "type_b"
  ]
}
```

An example managed object for the software package:

```json
{
  "type": "c8y_InstalledSoftware",
  "name": "Software Name",
  "id": "123",
  "softwareType": "yum",
  "version": "1.0",
  "url": "www.example.com",
  "owner": "service_advanced-software-mgmt"
}
```

Notice that the owner field is required and must be set to `service_advanced-software-mgmt` for the microservice to
detect the software package.

Querying, adding and removing software packages can be done with the microservice REST endpoints or using SmartREST
static templates.

#### Querying the software packages:

```http
GET /service/advanced-software-mgmt/software?deviceId=<deviceId>
```

```json
{
  "softwareList": [
    {
      "name": "software_a",
      "version": "3.0.0",
      "url": "http://example.com/software_a",
      "softwareType": "type A"
    },
    {
      "name": "software_b",
      "version": "2.0.0",
      "url": "http://example.com/software_b",
      "softwareType": "type B"
    }
  ],
  "statistics": {
    "currentPage": 1,
    "pageSize": 5
  },
  "self": ...,
  "next": ...
}
```

| Query paramater | Mandatory | Details |
| --------------- | --------- | ------- |
| deviceId        | Yes       | ID of the device |
| name            | No        | Filter parameter for the software name |
| version         | No        | Filter parameter for the software version |
| type            | No        | Filter parameter for the software type |
| pageSize        | No        | The number of items on the page of the paginated result, between 1 and 2000 |
| currentPage     | No        | The current page of the paginated result |
| withTotalPages  | No        | When set to `true`, the returned result will contain the total number of the pages in the statistics object |

#### Setting software packages

Advanced Software Management allows devices to set their installed software, similarly to legacy software management. In
this case any software communicated to the platform before is overwritten entirely with then new packages.

```http
POST /service/advanced-software-mgmt/software?deviceId=<deviceId>
```

```json
[
  {
    "name": "software_a",
    "version": "3.0.0",
    "url": "http://example.com/software_a",
    "softwareType": "type A"
  },
  {
    "name": "software_b",
    "version": "2.0.0",
    "url": "http://example.com/software_b",
    "softwareType": "type B"
  }
]
```

##### SmartREST example

Devices may also use the SmartREST static template 140 instead. It takes a list of software packages of dynamic length,
where each package is represented by its name, version, software type and URL:

`140,software_a,3.0.0,"type A",http://example.com/software_a,software_b,2.0.0,"type B",http://example.com/software_b`

#### Adding software packages

With Advanced Software Management devices may also append packages to their installed software without having to
announce the entire list.

```http
PUT /service/advanced-software-mgmt/software?deviceId=<deviceId>
```

```json
[
  {
    "name": "software_a",
    "version": "3.0.0",
    "url": "http://example.com/software_a",
    "softwareType": "type A"
  },
  {
    "name": "software_b",
    "version": "2.0.0",
    "url": "http://example.com/software_b",
    "softwareType": "type B"
  }
]
```

##### SmartREST example

Devices also use the SmartREST static template 141 instead. Similarly to 140, it takes a list of software packages of
dynamic

`141,software_a,3.0.0,"type A",http://example.com/software_a,software_b,2.0.0,"type B",http://example.com/software_b`

#### Removing software

In order to complete partial updates of installed software Advanced Software Management offers an interface to remove
individual packages from a device's installed software.

```http
DELETE /service/advanced-software-mgmt/software?deviceId=<deviceId>
```

```json
[
  {
    "name": "software_a",
    "version": "3.0.0"
  },
  {
    "name": "software_b",
    "version": "2.0.0"
  }
]
```

##### SmartREST example

Devices may also use the SmartREST static template 142 instead. It takes a list of software packages of dynamic length,
where each package is represented by its name and version, as URL and software type are not used to identify a package:

`142,software_a,3.0.0,software_b,2.0.0`

#### Changing installed software

Similarly, in the Advanced Software Management approach updating software packages requires sending to the device one of
the operations: `c8y_SoftwareUpdate` or `c8y_SoftwareList`, depending on which are specified
in `c8y_SupportedOperations` fragment. The only difference is that now software type property is required for software
packages.

##### Software update

The `c8y_SoftwareUpdate` operation contains also partial list of software packages, each with an instruction whether it
should be installed or uninstalled. This is very similar to legacy software management, however an additional parameter
indicating the software type of each package is also included.

```json
{
  "c8y_SoftwareUpdate": [
    {
      "name": "software_a",
      "version": "4.0.0",
      "url": "http://example.com/software_a",
      "softwareType": "type A",
      "action": "install"
    },
    {
      "name": "software_b",
      "version": "3.0.0",
      "url": "http://example.com/software_b",
      "softwareType": "type B",
      "action": "delete"
    }
  ]
}
```

| Field | DataType | Mandatory | Details |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
|name |string |Yes |Name of the software|
|version |string | Yes | A version identifier of the software|
|url |string |Yes |A URL pointing to the location where the software file should be downloaded from|
| softwareType | string| Yes | An arbitrary string for organizing software artifacts|
|action |string |Yes |Action to be executed from the device on the software (possible values: "install" or "delete")|

The device is expected to perform the following actions:

1. Set operation status to EXECUTING
2. Iterate through the list of packages contained in the operation and perform the respective action for each one
3. Update the software list in the device’s own managed object
4. Set operation status to SUCCESSFUL

**SmartREST example**

The 529 static response template is available for dealing with software update operations for devices that support
Advanced Software Management:

1. Receive ```c8y_SoftwareUpdate``` operation <br>
   `529,deviceSerial,software_a,4.0.0,"type A",http://example.com/software_a,install,software_b,3.0.0,"type B",http://example.com/software_b,delete`
2. Set operation status to EXECUTING <br>
   `501,c8y_SoftwareUpdate`
3. Uninstall and install software
4. Remove from the inventory uninstalled software packages <br>
   `142,software_b,3.0.0`
5. Add to the inventory installed software packages <br>
   `141,software_a,4.0.0,"type A",http://example.com/software_a`
5. Set operation status to SUCCESSFUL <br>
   `503,c8y_SoftwareUpdate`
