#### Example request - Create a new event

|HEADERS||
|:---|:---|
|Authorization|{{auth}}
|Host|{{hostname}}
|Content-Type|application/json
|Accept|application/vnd.com.nsn.cumulocity.event+json

```http
POST <<url>>/event/events

{
  "time" : "2011-09-06T12:03:27.845+02:00",
  "type" : "com_cumulocity_model_DoorSensorEvent",
  "text" : "Door sensor was triggered.",
  "source": {
	"id" : "12345",
	 ...
  }
}
```

#### Example response

|HEADERS||
|:---|:---|
|Content-Type|application/vnd.com.nsn.cumulocity.event+json;ver=...

```http
HTTP/1.1
201 - Created

{
  "id" : "10",
  "self" : "<<URL of new event>>",
  "time" : "2011-09-06T12:03:27.845+02:00",
  "creationTime" : "2011-09-06T12:03:27.927+02:00",
  "type" : "com_cumulocity_model_DoorSensorEvent",
  "text" : "Door sensor was triggered.",
  "source" : {
	"id":"12345",
	"self": "...",
	"name": "..."
  }
}
```

For POST requests, the source parameter is required to have only an `id`.

The `id` and `creationTime` of the new event are generated by the server and returned in the response to the POST operation.

In case of executing range queries on events API, like query by dateFrom and dateTo, the latest events are returned first. It is possible to change the order by adding query parameter "revert=true" to the request URL. In many use cases it is needed to get the oldest measurement sent from the device. This can be accomplished by passing "revert" param together with "dateFrom" and "dateTo" params to sort the outcome by date, e.g. pass dateFrom from a year ago, and dateTo from the feature.

### PUT - Update an event

### DELETE - Delete an event collection

The DELETE method allows for deletion of event collections. Applicable query parameters are equivalent to GET method.

**Request body:** N/A

**Response body:** N/A

**Required role:** ROLE\_EVENT\_ADMIN

#### Example request

|HEADERS||
|:---|:---|
|Authorization|{{auth}}
|Host|{{hostname}}

```http
     DELETE: <<url>>/event/events....
```

#### Example response

```http
HTTP/1.1
204 - NO CONTENT
```

> **Info:** DELETE requests are not synchronous. The response could be returned before the delete request has been completed. This may happen especially when the deleted event has a lot of associated data. After sending the request, the platform starts deleting the associated data in an asynchronous way. Finally, the requested event is deleted after all associated data has been deleted.
