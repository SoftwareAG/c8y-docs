The sensor library defines a canonical set of predefined sensor and control capabilities. A sensor capability describes the part of a device that can measure some quantity, while a control capability describes the part of a device that can be modified, changed or in some way remotely controlled.

The library is logically divided into subpackages related to the domain that the capability fits best, although applications are free to select capabilities from any domain. The name of the capability follows the naming conventions of fragments. There are Java representations of each of these capabilities that can be found in the Java packages corresponding to the fragment names.
