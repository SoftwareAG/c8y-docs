<td > An issue with asynchronous tenant deletion has been resolved. Previously, when the platform failed to delete one tenant (for example due to database issues), then it stopped processing the deletion of a task. The fix contains handling errors, which now enable the deletion of other tenants to continue. Additionally, after a tenant deletion task failed for tenants, it retries the operation for up to 10 times. If it fails 10 times, then the affected tenant is suspended and an alarm is raised on the Management tenant.</td>
