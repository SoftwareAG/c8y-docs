### Edge REST APIs with OpenAPI Specification

Edge 10.11 adopts the OpenAPI Specification as the standard format to specify the REST APIs. For more information, see [OpenAPI Specification for Edge](https://cumulocity.com/edge/api/10.11.0/).

### Changing the domain name

You can now change the domain name of your Edge appliance using the user interface or REST API. For more information, see [Changing the domain name](https://cumulocity.com/guides{{< 10-11-0 >}}/edge/configuration/#changing-domain-name).

### Remotely update the Edge appliance

You can now update the Edge appliance remotely from a tenant account. To use this feature, you must have remote-connectivity enabled in your Edge appliance. For more information, see [Updating Edge remotely](https://cumulocity.com/guides{{< 10-11-0 >}}/edge/update/#updating-edge-remotely).

### Update from 10.9 to 10.11

You can now update from Edge version 10.9 to 10.11 using the user interface or remotely from a tenant account.

### Remotely restart the Edge appliance

You can now restart the Edge appliance remotely from a tenant account. To use this feature, you must have remote-connectivity enabled in your Edge appliance. For more information, see [Restarting Edge remotely](https://cumulocity.com/guides{{< 10-11-0 >}}/edge/remote-connectivity/#updating-edge-remotely).

### User interface enhancements for configuration

You can now use the user interface to:

- [Enable the microservice hosting feature](https://cumulocity.com/guides{{< 10-11-0 >}}/edge/configuration/#enabling-or-disabling-the-microservice-hosting-feature-using-the-ui)
- [Expand the disk size](https://cumulocity.com/guides{{< 10-11-0 >}}/edge/configuration/#expanding-the-disk-size)

### Support for TLS 1.3

|<div style="width:100px">Ticket</div>|<div style="width:200px">Area</div>|Description
|:---|:---|:---
|IOT-11712|Karaf|**Issue:** Configurations in Edge which require a restart of Karaf, like for example enable/disable microservices, update, or reboot, could cause issues with Karaf start up.<br><br>**Workaround:** Restart the cumulocity-core-karaf service and retry the configuration, see <a href="https://cumulocity.com/guides/edge/diagnostics-and-support/#start-stop-services" class="no-ajaxy"> Diagnostics and support > Starting and stopping services </a> in the <i>Cumulocity IoT Edge guide</i>.
|CIE-2331|Administration|**Issue:** If you are upgrading from Edge version 10.9 where you have changed the remote tenant URL, you must change the tenant URL to something else and back to have the remote connectivity feature working, after the upgrade.
|CIE-2577|REST API|**Issue:** Sometimes, a request to an endpoint returns an HTTP status code 408: Request Timeout response. For example, a request to the endpoint /edge/tasks/{id} can return a 408 response.<br><br>**Workaround:** Ignore the 408 response and retry the request.
|CIE-2592|Microservices|**Issue:** The “Upload Microservice” option appears even if microservice hosting feature is not enabled.
