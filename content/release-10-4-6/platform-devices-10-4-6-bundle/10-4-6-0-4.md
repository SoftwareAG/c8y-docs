### Improvements

#### [Device Management] The smart groups filter is now configurable.

The filters in the **Devices** > **All Devices** page can now be configured. Subsequently, created smart groups will contain these filters.

#### Apama streaming analytics - New code editor and manager

A new developer experience is available when editing and deploying Apama EPL apps.

Whereas Apama EPL apps were previously uploaded using the Administration application, Apama EPL apps are now managed using a new application called Apama-epl.

![Apama-epl in app switcher](/images/release-notes/apama-epl-app-switcher.png)

The new Apama-epl application includes a management page where you can see all your Apama EPL apps. This page makes it easy to see which apps are activated and gives you the ability to provide each app with a meaningful description.

![Apama EPL Apps](/images/release-notes/apama-epl-apps-manager.png)

A full in-browser editor is available to develop your Apama EPL apps without having to manage the code in a separate environment.

![EPL editor](/images/release-notes/apama-epl-editor.png)

When you save and activate your EPL app using the editor, then any syntax errors are reported back immediately in the editor, helping you to ensure your application is in good shape.

![Error in EPL editor](/images/release-notes/apama-epl-editor-error.png)

If you prefer to develop your application outside of Cumulocity (for example, using the feature-rich Software AG Designer desktop tooling), then you can import your apps into the Apama-epl application.

![Import Apama EPL App](/images/release-notes/apama-epl-apps-import.png)

If you have previously uploaded Apama EPL apps using the **Applications > Own applications** page, then you have to migrate these apps manually. To do so, import the source code of your existing applications into the Apama-epl application.

If you need the original source code, then note that the previously uploaded Apama EPL apps can be found as *.mon files in the files repository.

Behind the scenes, the microservice named apama-small has been replaced by apama-ctrl and the new user interfaces provided by the Apama-epl application.

For further details on Apama streaming analytics, refer to the [*Streaming Analytics guide*](https://cumulocity.com/guides/10.4.6/apama).


#### Device Management/Cockpit - New drag & drop functionality

You can now easily re-structure groups and devices per drag & drop functionality in the navigator.

For details, see [Device Management > Grouping devices](https://cumulocity.com/guides/10.4.6/users-guide/device-management#grouping-devices) in the *User guide*.

#### Sigfox - Migration to API v2

The Sigfox microservice is now using Sigfox API version 2.
