> **Important for customers deploying and operating their own instance of Cumulocity IoT:**
>
> An issue has been identified that can lead to excessive RAM usage which finally leads to problems with the Linux OOM-Killer mechanism. Customers deploying and operating their own instance of Cumulocity IoT, are asked to follow the updated instructions on the configuration of memory settings  described here:
>
>* *Backend installation > Create the Cumulocity environment file > Important configuration items* in the *Multi-node installation guide*.
>* *Operational procedures > Karaf memory considerations* in the *Operations guide*.

>**Info:** Release 10.4.6.20 has implemented an improvement, which allows to calculate more accurate statistics on resource consumption of microservices. Currently, this can lead to high CPU load when subscriptions of microservices change frequently.
>
>We will improve this in one of the following Maintenance releases but release 10.4.6.23 is still affected. We will keep you informed.
>
>As a workaround to limit CPU costs for this calculation we recommend the following configuration change.
>
>On all core nodes, add the following to */etc/cumulocity/cumulocity-core.properties*:
>
>		"concurrency.tenant-usage-flush.core-pool-size" => "1"
>		"concurrency.tenant-usage-flush.rejected" => "DISCARD"
>		"concurrency.tenant-usage-flush.queue-size" => "1000”
>
>The preferred way of doing this is to apply the changes to the Chef server environment configuration.
