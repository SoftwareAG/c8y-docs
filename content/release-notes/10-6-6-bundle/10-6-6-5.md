<td > New advanced settings have been introduced for the Java Microservice SDK that allow the developer to alter the connection pool settings.
These settings can be considered to be used if the request/connection times out or no route to host exceptions are being experienced for the requests to the microservice. These settings should only be altered where the network environment is fully understood.<br> 
<br>The following properties, which can be specified in the microservice's property file, are available:
<br>"C8Y.httpClient.httpReadTimeout" (default: 180000 in ms)
<br>"C8Y.httpClient.pool.enabled" (default: true)
<br>"C8Y.httpClient.pool.perHost" (default: 50)
<br>"C8Y.httpClient.pool.max" (default: 100)
<br>"C8Y.httpClient.pool.awaitTimeout" (default: 10000 in ms)

<br><br>Actility microservice:
<br>The httpClient configurations for concurrent request limit to the Cumulocity  IoT host (C8Y.httpClient.pool.perHost) and maximum number of connection limit (C8Y.httpClient.pool.max) have increased by default with the following setting in the microservice's property file:
<br>C8Y.httpClient.pool.perHost=120
<br>C8Y.httpClient.pool.max=240 </td>
