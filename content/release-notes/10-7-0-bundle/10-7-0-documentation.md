In addition to new feature descriptions and chances related to the new features, improvements and fixes of the 10.7.0 release, the following improvements or modifications have been made in the area of documentation.

### Device SDK guide - NEW Linux agent documentation

The [Linux Agent User guide](/device-sdk/linux-agent-user-guide) describes prerequisites, how to build the agent, basic configurations, how to start the agent process, and how to build packages from an end user perspective. 

The [Linux Agent Developer guide](/device-sdk/linux-agent-developer-guide) contains various Lua plugin examples (Hello world, sending measurements, restart your machine, and more) for developers. 

### NEW Protocol integration guide

[MTM-29779] The documentation for the device integration protocols (like LWM2M, Sigfox and OPC UA) has been moved into a separate guide called *[Protocol integration guide](/protocol-integration/overview)* to provide a clearer structure and easier navigation.

### Cloud Remote Access - NEW API documentation

Information on the Cloud Remote Access API has been added to the Cloud Remote Access documentation. 

As a result, the Cloud Remote Access documentation, which formerly could be found in the *Optional services* section of the *User guide*, has been moved into a separate [Cloud Remote Access guide](/cloud-remote-access/cra-general-aspects/), providing a clearer structure and easier navigation.
