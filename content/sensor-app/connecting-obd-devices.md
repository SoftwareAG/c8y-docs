Connections to OBD devices work in a slightly different way than normal Bluetooth sensors. They must be connected to the phone directly before the device can be added to the {{< sensor-app >}}.

In case of WiFi based OBD devices, the procedure is as follows:

* Plug the OBD dongle into the vehicle's diagnostic port. Ensure that the power LED is illuminated.
* On the phone, navigate to the WiFi settings in the Settings application.
* Search for new networks, and join the "WiFi_OBDII" network (or other name as specified in the device's documentation), to pair directly with the dongle.
* If a password is required to do this, refer to your device's documentation.
* Once the device is connected, return to the {{< sensor-app >}}, and click the plus ("+") button at the bottom right of the screen.
* The OBD device should then become available in the list of available devices and can be added as any other Bluetooth sensor.

For Bluetooth-based OBD devices, the device must be paired with the phone before the {{< sensor-app >}} will recognize it:

* Plug the OBD dongle into the vehicle's diagnostic port. Ensure that the power LED is illuminated.
* On the phone, navigate to the WiFi settings in the Settings application.
* Scan for new Bluetooth devices and connect to the device named "ODBII" (or other name as specified in the device's documentation).
* The pairing process will ask for a PIN, consult your device's documentation to find this value.
* Once the device is connected, return to the {{< sensor-app >}}, and click the plus ("+") button in the bottom right of the screen.
* The OBD device should then become available in the list of available devices and can be added as any other Bluetooth sensor.
