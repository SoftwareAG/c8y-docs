Microservices can be filtered by name and availability.

A microservice is a specific type of application, that is a server-side application used to develop further functionality on top of {{< product-c8y-iot >}}. As web applications, microservices can either be subscribed to your tenant by the platform or by a service provider, or they can be owned by you as custom applications, see [Custom microservices](#custom-microservices).

### Subscribed microservices

{{< product-c8y-iot >}} provides a variety of microservice applications for different purposes. Depending on your installation and/or optional services your tenant will show a selection of the potentially available applications.

Below you find a list of all microservices which are by default subscribed in a {{< standard-tenant >}} and/or {{< enterprise-tenant >}}. In addition, numerous optional microservices might be subscribed to your tenant.

### Custom microservices

<a name="adding-microservices"></a>
#### To add a microservice as custom application

1. Click **Add microservice** at the top right.
2. In the resulting dialog box, drop a ZIP file or browse for it in your file system. Note that the size limit of the file to be uploaded is 500 MB.
3. The microservice application is created once the ZIP file has been successfully uploaded.

{{< c8y-admon-important >}}
The ZIP file must contain the application manifest and the Docker image of the microservice. Refer to [General aspects](/microservice-sdk/concept) for information on preparing and deploying the microservice package. You can provide the name of the microservice in its manifest file. If no name is provided in the file, the platform will derive it from the ZIP file name by removing the recognized version suffix. In any case the length of the resulting name must not exceed 23 characters.
