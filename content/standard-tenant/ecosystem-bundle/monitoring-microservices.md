You can monitor microservices hosted by {{< product-c8y-iot >}} in two ways.

### Status information

The status of the microservice can be checked in the **Status** tab of the respective microservice application.

<img src="/images/users-guide/Administration/admin-microservice-status.png" alt="Microservice status" style="max-width: 100%">

To view the status you need the following permissions: role Application management READ and role Inventory READ.

The following information is provided on the **Status** tab:

* Instances - number of active, unhealthy and desired microservice instances for the current tenant.
* Subscriptions - number of active, unhealthy and desired microservice instances for all subtenants subscribed to the microservice.
* Alarms - alarms for given application, provided in realtime.
* Events - events for given application, provided in realtime.
* Smart rules - list of applicable smart rules.

#### Alarms and events

Most of the alarms and events visible in the **Status** tab are strictly technical descriptions of what's going on with the microservice.

There are two user-friendly alarm types:

* `c8y_Application_Down` - critical alarm which is created when no microservice instance is available.
* `c8y_Application_Unhealthy` - major alarm which is created when there is at least one microservice instance working properly, but not all of them are fully operating.

User-friendly alarms are created for the microservice owner tenant only. They are also automatically cleared when the situation gets back to normal, that is all the microservice instances are working properly.

User-friendly alarms can be used to create smart rules. For details on creating smart rules of various types, see [Smart rules](/users-guide/cockpit/#smart-rules).

For example, to send an email, if a microservice is down, create an "On alarm send email" smart rule.

In the **On alarm matching** section, use `c8y_Application_Down` as an alarm type. As a target asset select the microservice which you would like to monitor, for example "echo-agent-server".

### Log files

{{< product-c8y-iot >}} offers viewing logs which provide more details on the status of microservices owned by the tenant.

To view logs, open the **Logs** tab of the respective microservice.

At the top of the page, you can select the instance of the microservice, for which you want to view the logs.

{{< c8y-admon-info >}}
If your microservice was re-scaled into two instances you should be able to switch between them, but it is not possible to see the logs from both instances at once.
{{< /c8y-admon-info >}}

Next to the instance dropdown you can select the time range for the log entries to be shown by selecting a date from the calendar and entering a time.

{{< c8y-admon-info >}}
The time entered here may differ from the server time due to different time zones.
{{< /c8y-admon-info >}}

At the top right, additional functionality is provided:

* **Download** - to download the log data for a specified time range.
* **Dark theme** - to turn dark theme on or off.
* **Auto refresh** - to activate the auto refresh functionality. If activated, the displayed log data will automatically be refreshed every 10 seconds.

Initially, the **Logs** tab shows the latest logs of the microservice instance.

At the bottom right you find navigation buttons:

* **First** - directly navigates to the oldest available log entries for the microservice after its restart (maximum capacity 35 MB of logs).
* **Previous** - increases the time range in 10 minutes steps.
* **Next** - reduces the time range in 10 minutes steps.
* **Last** - directly navigates to the latest available log entries.

If no logs are available in the selected time range, a message is shown accordingly:

{{< c8y-admon-info >}}
There is no possibility to see the logs from the previously running instances or from previously rotated logs exceeding 35 MB. However, inside the instance there is a Docker container running, and if only this one was restarted (not the whole instance) you should see the logs from the currently running and also lately terminated Docker container.

Logs are always loaded from the Docker container using both `stdout` and `stderr` sources, and there is no possibility to distinguish/filter by the source.
