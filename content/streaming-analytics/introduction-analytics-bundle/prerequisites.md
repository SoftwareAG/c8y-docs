### Browsers {#browsers}

The Streaming Analytics application supports the same browsers as {{< product-c8y-iot >}}, with the following exception: browsers on smartphones and tablets are not supported.

### Permissions {#permissions}

To use Analytics Builder, you must at least have the following permissions:

|Permission type|Permission level|
|---------------|----------------|
|CEP management|ADMIN|
|Option management|READ|
|Inventory|READ|

This is typically achieved by using a global role which has those permissions, and where the role has access to the Analytics Builder application. See [Managing permissions](/standard-tenant/managing-permissions/) for details.

To use EPL Apps, you only need the following permission:

|Permission type|Permission level|
