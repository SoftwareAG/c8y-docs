### Customer responsibilities

As a Customer of the {{< product-c8y-iot >}} platform, we request your acknowledgment of the following responsibilities to ensure the continued security, performance, and efficiency of the service:

##### **Security management**

* **Device security:** While the {{< product-c8y-iot >}} platform provides robust security measures, Customer is responsible for the security of devices and device credentials. {{< company-c8y >}} cannot be held liable for any leaked credentials from devices. Customer acknowledges that communication protocols and ciphers may require periodic updates to address evolving security threats. This may necessitate updates to the devices themselves.
* **End user access security:** To protect the integrity of the cloud platform, Customer is encouraged to educate users on secure usage practices, such as implementing multi-factor authentication. Customer is responsible for managing user credentials, and {{< company-c8y >}} cannot be held responsible for any compromised credentials.
* **Certificate management:** Customer is responsible for monitoring the expiration of their certificates. Expired certificates can result in service unavailability for the associated clients, and Customer expressly acknowledges this responsibility.
* **Library updates:** Customers utilizing {{< company-c8y >}}-provided libraries to build their own applications are responsible for ensuring these libraries are kept up to date with respect to security. In the event of a security vulnerability or other critical update, it is Customer's responsibility to implement the necessary updates in their applications to maintain the integrity and security of their systems. {{< company-c8y >}} cannot be held liable for any security issues arising from outdated libraries in Customer applications.

##### **Capacity management**

* **Scalability considerations:** While the {{< product-c8y-iot >}} platform is designed to be scalable, it may not be able to accommodate sudden, extreme capacity demands (for example, all devices attempting to connect simultaneously after a connectivity outage, or all devices being upgraded at the same time). Customer acknowledges that such requests may be delayed or declined by the platform to maintain overall service stability. Customer is advised to implement an [exponential backoff strategy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_backoff).
* **Soft quotas:** Customer acknowledges the existence of "soft quotas" as documented in the {{< product-c8y-iot >}} documentation [here](/concepts/limits/). These quotas are not strictly enforced but exceeding them may lead to a reduced service level, and Customer is advised to operate within these guidelines.
* **Data retention management:** Data storage is included as part of Customer’s subscription. Customer is responsible for configuring appropriate data retention rules within the {{< product-c8y-iot >}} Administration application, balancing their specific use case requirements with budgetary considerations.

For details on non-permitted uses of {{< product-c8y-iot >}}, please refer to the {{< product-c8y-iot >}} Terms of Service.

### Limitations and constraints

In the interest of transparency and to ensure a mutual understanding of the service capabilities, we kindly ask Customer to acknowledge the following limitations and constraints of the {{< product-c8y-iot >}} platform:

* **Hard quotas:** Customer acknowledges the existence of hard quotas as detailed in the {{< product-c8y-iot >}} documentation [here](/concepts/limits/). These quotas define maximum thresholds that the platform can support and are essential for maintaining overall system stability.
* **Shared environment considerations:** Customers not utilizing {{< product-c8y-iot >}} Dedicated plans should be aware that their tenant is hosted within a shared environment. As a result, response times may occasionally vary due to shared resource usage, and Customer acknowledges such variations. Furthermore, infrastructure-level information such as HTTP or MQTT access logs cannot be shared with Customer.
* **Data retention and storage costs:** Customer acknowledges that reducing data retention periods does not immediately lead to the reclamation of storage space or a reduction in storage costs due to technical processing requirements.
* **Distributed IoT system:** Customer acknowledges that IoT systems, by nature, are distributed and Internet-based:
    * **Connectivity reliability:** Connectivity may occasionally fail. To ensure reliable communication, Customer devices and clients should implement appropriate reconnect or retry strategies. Singular connection drops or temporary failures are considered normal and do not constitute a service failure. {{< company-c8y >}} is committed to working with Customer to troubleshoot and resolve consistent and repeating communication issues.
    * **Third-party connectivity services:** Connectivity may involve third-party services such as LPWAN or mobile network operators. Customer acknowledges that while {{< product-c8y-iot >}} facilitates the transfer of data through these services, it does not operate, monitor, or troubleshoot these third-party networks. Connectivity between Customer's devices and {{< product-c8y-iot >}} service is in the sole responsibility of Customer.
* **Data recovery**: While {{< company-c8y >}} maintains backups of data for its own business continuity management, disaster recovery on behalf of Customer (for example, after accidental data deletion by Customer) is a separate service. Customer expressly acknowledges the backup retention period and RPO outline above.
