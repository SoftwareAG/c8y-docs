    content: "The Cumulocity IoT user management allows you to manage the users within your tenant. You can create new users, assign usernames and passwords, store user details, or configure the login and security options.  


    Moreover you can select the global roles for a user, see also *Administration > Managing permissions* in the *User guide*."
---

The **user management feature** allows you to manage the users within your tenant, that is create users, store user details, or configure login and security options.

{{< c8y-admon-req >}}
ROLES & PERMISSIONS:

"User management" permission type:
* To view users: READ permission
* To manage (create, edit, delete, disable/enable, delegate, manage permissions) all existing users: ADMIN permission
* To create users: CREATE permission

"Own user management" permission type (has no influence on user management capabilities):
* To view the own user: READ permission
* To edit the own user: ADMIN permission

Note that each user created on the platform can edit its own information by default, regardless of the "Own user management" permissions. The purpose of the "Own user management" permission is to manage specific users created for technical purposes, for example, by microservices, and determine whether such users can be managed by respective services.

On tenant creation, there are default roles available that can be used as a sample configuration for the above mentioned permissions:
* Global User Manager - Can access and modify the full user hierarchy
* Shared User Manager - Can create new users as his own subusers and manage them ("feature-user-hierarchy" application subscription required)

Note that when subscribed to the "feature-user-hierachy" application, the CREATE permission allows to manage (display, create, edit, delete, disable/enable, delegate, manage permissions) underlying users. For details see [Managing user hierarchies](/users-guide/enterprise-tenant/#user-hierarchies).
{{< /c8y-admon-req >}}

If your tenant is configured for using single sign-on (SSO) in {{< sag-cloud >}}, new users should be created under **My Cloud**, accessible through the application switcher in the upper right corner, so that they are able to use the single sign-on feature.

For users created via an external authorization server, updating the following settings in {{< product-c8y-iot >}} will have no effect (will be reset on the next user re-login):

* user info (login alias, email, first name, last name, telephone)
* global roles - configurable via SSO access mapping
* application access - configurable via SSO access mapping
* inventory roles assignments - configurable via SSO access mapping

Moreover, password reset in {{< product-c8y-iot >}} is disabled for users created through an external authentication server.

{{< c8y-admon-info >}}
Users which are using single sign-on cannot change the password of users which are managed by the platform.

### To view users

To view all users in your tenant, click **Users** in the **Accounts** menu in the navigator.

![Expanded view](/images/users-guide/Administration/admin-users-list.png)

A user list will be displayed, providing the following information for each user:

* The username that is used to access the tenant.
* The name and email of the user (if set).
* The global roles assigned to the user.
* The [strength](/users-guide/getting-started/#change-password) of the password set for the user

To filter the list by username, you can use the filter field at the left of the top menu bar. With the dropdown list you can filter by global roles. For details on filtering, see [Getting started > UI functionalities and features > Filtering](/users-guide/getting-started/#filtering).

In order to apply the selected filters click **Apply**.

Initially, the **User** page only shows the top-level users. To see all users in your account at once, click **Expand all** at the right of the top bar. This will expand all top-level users, showing their sub-users. Click **Collapse all** to just show the top-level users again. For details on user hierarchies, refer to [Managing user hierarchies](/users-guide/enterprise-tenant/#user-hierarchies).

### To add a user

1. Click **Add user** at the right of the top menu bar.  
  {{< c8y-admon-info >}}
If single sign-on is enabled for your tenant, a message will show up which reminds you that you are about to create a local user which will not be able to login via single sign-on. Create new users in **My Cloud** instead, accessible through the application switcher in the upper right corner, to enable them using the single sign-on feature.
  {{< /c8y-admon-info >}}

   2. At the left of the **New user** window, provide the following information to identify the user:

       <table>
           <thead>
               <colgroup>
                   <col style="width: 20%;">

               <tr>
                   <td align="left">Login alias</td>
                   <td align="left">In addition to the username, an optional alias can be provided to be used to log on. In contrast to the username, this alias may be changed if required. The login alias cannot be the same as the username. Note that the login alias is not supported for devices.
                   </td>
               </tr>

While entering the password, the strength of the password will be checked. See [To change your password](/users-guide/getting-started/#change-password) for further information on password reset and strength.
