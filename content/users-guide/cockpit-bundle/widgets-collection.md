Only users with the permission to edit the home dashboard will be able to provide this message.


<a name="asset-properties"></a>
### Asset properties

The "Asset properties" widget displays a user-defined list of attributes of the current object. The current object can be a device or a group.

![Asset properties widget](/images/users-guide/cockpit/cockpit-widget-asset-properties.png)


**Parameters to configure**

|Field|Description|
|:---|:---|
|Title|Widget title. By default, the widget type is used as title.
|Target assets or devices|Select groups or devices.

{{< /c8y-admon-info >}}

<a name="widget-asset-table"></a>
### Asset table

The "Asset table" widget shows details of a selected asset and all its child devices in a table. This is a very powerful widget, allowing to arrange selected properties of objects in a table.

**Parameters to configure**

|Field|Description|
|:---|:---|
|Title|Widget title. By default, the widget type is simply used as title.
|Target assets or devices|Select for which object all child devices should be shown. This is typically a group object.
|Properties|Select properties or actions of an object to visualize them as columns in the table.

**Example**

In the following screenshot, five columns are configured. Three property columns "Name", "Owner", and "Type", which refer to the properties "name", "owner" and "type" respectively. Additionally, there are two actions, one for toggling the maintenance mode, and one for rebooting the device.

![Asset table widget](/images/users-guide/cockpit/cockpit-widget-asset-table.png)

The resulting table is visualized as follows:
![Asset table widget example](/images/users-guide/cockpit/cockpit-widget-asset-table-example.png)

#### To add properties

Click **+Add Properties** and select one or more properties to be added.

{{< c8y-admon-info >}}
The property "Active alarm status" shows active alarms as icons in the table. If you select this property, you also must configure the renderer "Active Alarm Status" in the list of columns.
{{< /c8y-admon-info >}}

#### To add actions

1. Click **+Add Action**.
1. Select **Toggle maintenance mode** to add the predefined action to toggle the maintenance mode.
1. Select **Create operation** to create a button that will execute a shell command. In the resulting dialog box you can then enter the label for the button and the shell command to be executed.

![Reboot device button configuration](/images/users-guide/cockpit/cockpit-widget-asset-table-buttonconfig.png)

{{< c8y-admon-info >}}
The dialog shows the predefined shell commands of the first device that supports shell commands. The list is empty if there is no such device. For more details, refer to [Device Management > Device details > Shell](/users-guide/device-management/#shell).<br>
You can also enter the JSON format for the operation that will be sent to the device. For details, contact the device vendor for supported operations.
{{< /c8y-admon-info >}}

#### To modify the table

To edit the header of a column, click on its value in the **Label** column and edit the label.

You can rearrange the columns by clicking the icon at the very left of a row and dragging and dropping the entry.

To remove a property or an action, hover over the respective row and click **Delete** at the right.

<a name="data-graph"></a>
### Data point graph

The "Data point graph" widget shows a data point (measurement) in a graph. The visualization is the same as in the [data explorer](/users-guide/cockpit/#data-explorer).

![Data Point Graph widget](/images/users-guide/cockpit/cockpit-datapointsgraph-widget.png)

The easiest way to create a "Data point graph" widget is to navigate to the data explorer, click the <b>More...</b> button in the top menu bar and select <b>Send as widget to dashboard</b>.

Refer to [Visualizing data using the data explorer](/users-guide/cockpit/#data-explorer) for further details on the parameters to be configured.

At the top right of the data point graph, an **Auto scroll** toggle determines the display behavior:

* Auto-scroll on - When a new measurement arrives, the widget automatically scrolls to the top so that you can see the latest value.
* Auto-scroll off - When a new measurement arrives, the display does not change and the table still shows the same snippet of data.

The icons representing the devices are color-coded. The color used follows these rules:

* Red = At least one CRITICAL alarm
* Orange = At least one MAJOR alarm
* Yellow = At least one MINOR alarm
* Blue = At least one WARNING
* Green = No alarm

Click a device icon, to open a popup with the following information:

* The date at which the device last reported its location, if available.
* A toggle to show/hide the device tracks for the previous and current days.

**Parameters to configure**
