If you want to make changes to the settings of the smartphone or a connected Bluetooth device, simply tap the 3 dots at the top right of the card for this device. Various options will be displayed at bottom of the screen. For Bluetooth devices, the options **Disconnect**, **Disable** and **Edit** are available. The smartphone itself only has the **Disable** and **Edit** options.

Tapping **Disconnect** removes a Bluetooth device from your smartphone entirely.

Tapping **Disable** still allows the smartphone to monitor measurements from this device, but stops sending sensor measurements to {{< product-c8y-iot >}}.

Tapping **Edit**, or swiping upwards, reveals further settings that allow you to adjust various properties about this sensor, such as its name and update intervals.

Smaller update intervals provide better response times and more complete measurement data, but also lead to higher power usage.
