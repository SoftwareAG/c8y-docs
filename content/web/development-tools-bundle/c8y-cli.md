title: C8Y Command Line Tool (CLI)
layout: redirect
weight: 10
---

To support you with bootstrapping, running and deploying applications we have build a Command Line Interface. The tool is the successor of the `cumulocity-node-tools`. To avoid conflicts, it listens to the new command `c8ycli` instead of `c8y`. You can install it via npm:

```
npm install -g @c8y/cli
```


### Usage

```
c8ycli [options] [command]
```

{{< c8y-admon-info >}}
The commands must be executed from the root path of the project.
{{< /c8y-admon-info >}}

### Options

```
    -u, --url <url>                 The URL of the remote instance
    --version                       Provides version number
    -h, --help                      Provides usage information
```

### Commands

All the commands except of ```new``` take an array of [glob patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_(programming)). These will be solved to folders or entry point manifests.

```
    new [name] [template]                   Creates a folder to start a new application or extend an existing one
    serve [options] [appPaths...]           Runs local development server
    build [options] [appPaths...]           Builds the specified applications
    deploy [options] [appPaths...]          Deploys applications from the specified paths
    locale-extract [options] [srcPaths...]  Extracts all strings for translation and outputs the .po files to defined folder
```

### The `new` command
The `c8ycli new [name] [template]` helps to start an empty application or to extend one of our existing applications (Cockpit, Devicemanagement or Administration). To extend an existing application use as `[name]` and `[template]` the name of the existing application like this:
```
$ c8ycli new cockpit cockpit
```

{{< c8y-admon-tip >}}
The `c8ycli new` command has a `-a` flag which defines which package to use for scaffolding. This way you can also define which version of the app you want to scaffold, for example:
- `c8ycli new my-cockpit cockpit -a @c8y/apps@1004.11.0` will scaffold an app with the version `10.4.11.0`
- `c8ycli new my-cockpit cockpit -a @c8y/apps@latest` will scaffold an app with the latest official release. Same as if used without the `-a` flag
- `c8ycli new my-cockpit cockpit -a @c8y/apps@next` will scaffold an app with the latest beta release.

The `c8ycli new` command can also be provided on its own without the `[name]` and `[template]` options. In this case a few steps must be completed via the interface before the app is scaffolded.

**Step 1:**
```
? Enter the name of the project: (my-application)
```

The first step asks for the project name. If no project name is entered, the default value `my-application` is used.

{{< c8y-admon-info >}}
This step can also be skipped if the name is provided in the initial command: `c8ycli new my-application`.
{{< /c8y-admon-info >}}

**Step 2:**
```
? Which base version do you want to scaffold from? (Use arrow keys)
> 1010.0.X (latest)
> 1011.X.0 (next)
> 1011.0.X
> 1009.0.X
> 1007.0.X
> 1006.0.X
> other
```

In the second step, the base scaffolding version must be selected. The interface will provide the last GA release (latest), the latest available release (next) and four older GA releases. Additionally a version can be manually entered by selecting the `other` option.

**Step 2 (other):**
```
? Enter the desired version:
```

In this step, the desired version must be entered manually, for example, `1010.0.0`.

{{< c8y-admon-info >}}
This question will appear only if `other` was selected in the previous step.
{{< /c8y-admon-info >}}

**Step 3:**

```
? Which base project do you want to scaffold from?
  administration
  application
  cockpit
  devicemanagement
  hybrid
  tutorial
```

In the final step, the base project to scaffold from must be selected.

{{< c8y-admon-info >}}
This step will only show projects which are available for the selected version in Step 2.
{{< /c8y-admon-info >}}

### Application options

Application options can be defined with ```--app.<option>=<value>```. These will be applied to all applications found with ```[appPaths...]```.

```
    --app.name="My Application"
    --app.key=myapp-key
    --app.contextPath=myapplication
    --app.brandingEntry="./branding/mybranding.less"
```

### Webpack options

Webpack options can be defined with ```--env.<option>=<value>```. These will be directly passed to the webpack configuration.

```
    --env.mode="production"
    --env.hmr
```
