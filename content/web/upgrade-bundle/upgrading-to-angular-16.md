Angular 16 is supported from version `1019.0.0`. With the latest release of version 1019.0.0, the Web SDK has transitioned to using ng-cli, marking
the end of further development for c8ycli.

This switch aims to align with industry standards, making it more convenient for developers to work
with the Web SDK. If you're an Angular developer looking to migrate your existing Web SDK project to
ng-cli, here's a step-by-step guide to assist you through the process.

**1. Create an ng-cli Project**

Start by downloading the appropriate version of ng-cli and scaffold your project using the `ng new`
command. Make sure to use the name of your existing project during this process.

**2. Add @c8y/websdk to Build an App**

Integrate the @c8y/websdk into your ng-cli project by running `ng add @c8y/websdk`. Ensure you
select the correct project type: `application` or `hybrid`.

**3. Copy Over Source Files**

Copy all your components, directives, modules, tests, and services files to the new ng-cli project.
Also, migrate any non-standard files, such as assets, to the new project.

**4. Align the package.json**

Update your package.json file by verifying and comparing dependencies. Ensure that you retain the
new dependencies while adding any custom dependencies. Update other properties from your original
project, excluding the "c8y" property object. Change all scripts to use `ng` instead of `c8ycli` and
rename any occurrences of "server" to "serve."

**5. Align cumulocity.config.ts**

Transfer all "c8y.application" properties from the package.json file to the new cumulocity.config
`runTime` object. Format it as JavaScript and check for errors. Check if federation sharing is
sufficient; otherwise, adjust as needed. Some options may need to be moved to `buildTime`.

**6. Verify tsconfig Files**

Review and align the tsconfig files according to your project's needs. You might need to disable
certain strict configurations, such as `noPropertyAccessFromIndexSignature` or `noImplicitReturns`,
which are enabled by default.

**7. Install Dependencies and Verify**

Install dependencies and ensure that all peer dependencies match. Update any dependencies that may
require modification to run seamlessly with Angular 16.

**8. Check the Angular Update Guide**

As ng-cli uses Angular 16, check the Angular update guide to ensure compatibility.

**9. Start it**

Finally, attempt to run your application using `npm start` or `npx ng <<name-of-your-app>>`. Check
for compilation errors and resolve any issues. For Angular 16, remove all `entryComponents` arrays
in the modules, as they were deprecated in version 15 and removed in version 16.

**Common Pitfalls**

- Ensure that the rxjs `Subject` is correctly typed with `void` if it should only emit without a
  value.
- Remove all `entryComponents` from your code.
- Import `ApplicationOptions` from the `@c8y/devkit/dist/options` package, and consider importing
  only the types to avoid unnecessary bundling (`import type from '@c8y/devkit/dist/options';`).
